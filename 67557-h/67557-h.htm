    <div>Excerpts from the Professional Press on the work of</div>
    <div class='c002'><span class='large'>DR. WM. STEKEL</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>We have lacked thus far a systematic clinical application of Freudian
analysis. Stekel’s work fills this need.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Jung</em>, in <span class='sc'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Medis. Klinik</span></span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>... A standard work; a milestone in the psychiatric and psychotherapeutic
literature.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Geh. Sanitätsrat <em>Dr. Gerstor</em>, in <span class='sc'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Neue Generation</span></span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>It would be regrettable if the work did not attract fully the attention
of the scientific world; its deep sobriety and the fulness of its
details render it a treasury of information, primarily for the physician,
but, in large measure, of interest also to the educationist, the minister,
the teacher and, not least, to the student of criminology....</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Horch</em>, in <span class='sc'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Archiv f. Kriminalogie</span></span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>These case histories will be read with great interest by everyone,
including those who are inclined to maintain a sceptical attitude towards
psychoanalysis.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Eulenburg</em>, in <span class='sc'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Medizinische Klinik</span></span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Stekel’s work teaches practitioners a great many things they did not
know before, particularly about the significance of psychology and sexual
science in the practice of medicine.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Hitschmann</em>, in <span class='sc'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Internat. Zeitschrift f. Psychoanalyse</span></span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>It is Stekel’s extraordinary merit that he compels us to take into
account a pressing mass of data which he brings to light with a scientific
zeal which is unfortunately still rare,—facts and observations so
penetrating, so true to life that these often render unnecessary any
formal statement of the obvious deductions which flow from them.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Neue Generation.</span></span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The most modern problems are considered, new viewpoints are
brought out, while the excesses in the technique and interpretation of
the earlier stages of psychoanalysis are avoided.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Kermauner</em>, in <span class='sc'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift</span></span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>All in all, Stekel’s is a work for which I bespeak the widest interest
not only among physicians, but also among jurists, educationists,
sociologists and ministers. Only an understanding of the mental life
of the individual will yield a proper view of our social life.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Liepmann</em>, in <span class='sc'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeitschrift f. Sexualwissensch</span></span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The work is a treasury for all who have occasion to probe the depths
of human life and should be a source of considerable information and
stimulus to every jurist who takes in earnest his professional duties.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>Geh. Justizrat <em>Dr. Horch</em>, in <span class='sc'>Archiv f. Kriminalogie</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>It does not matter from what angle the work of Stekel is approached.
Any consideration of it reveals rich material. Stekel is
a writer who handles his subjects in a lavish manner; lavish, but with
that restraint which bends all to the urgency of his themes. He evidently
approaches his clinical work with the same exuberant interest.
There he reaps through psychoanalysis a rich harvest of results. He has
collected these results and presented them for the dissemination of such
knowledge of the sexual disturbances as he thus obtained. Facts are there
in great number. They cannot be gainsaid. Stekel’s own evaluation of
such facts and his earnest plea for their consideration, both by the medical
profession and by the society of men and women where these facts
exist, can speak only for themselves to the truly conscientious reader.
There is not much in these books that the psychotherapeutist can afford
to pass over.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The present volume completes my English version
of the <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Homosexualität</span></cite> portion of the author’s
<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Onanie und Homosexualität</span></cite>. The first portion has
been issued a few months ago, under the title <cite>Bisexual
Love</cite>, and it is very gratifying that the publication
of the present volume was made possible so
soon after the appearance of the first. The translation
of the part dealing with <em>Autoerotism</em> is also
completed, and will appear shortly. One of the
most important works of clinical psychopathology
will thus be available, for the English reading professional
ranks, in unabridged form.</p>

<p class='c004'>These three volumes, though available separately,
in some respects form an instructive continuity.
At any rate those interested in any of the fundamental
problems discussed therein will find most
helpful an acquaintance with all three volumes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Furthermore the student or physician interested
in mental problems will find the implications of
the principles set forth herein of the utmost practical
significance, aside from their specific bearing
on the problems of Homosexuality and Autoerotism.
These clinical studies stand forth, in the first place,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>as lessons in analysis and therapy; but incidentally
they reveal certain fundamental aspects of human
nature more clearly than such a revelation was possible
without the aid of the psychoanalytic method
of research. The knowledge thus gained for therapeutic
purposes is also applicable to many other
practical problems of life. One approaching the
study of a work like the present, with the intention
of improving one’s therapeutic efficiency and of thus
increasing one’s professional usefulness, is quite
likely to discover before long that his whole outlook,
as a professional man, and, above all, as a
social being, has undergone a wholesome transformation.</p>

<p class='c004'>Indeed, all fundamental knowledge has this quality
of spreading, fan-like, clearing up with its helpful
implications more than appears obvious at the beginning.
It is not surprising, therefore, that Psychoanalysis,
at the present stage primarily a therapeutic
method, but reaching into the inner recesses
of the human soul more penetratingly than any other
method of inquiry, should also prove the most helpful
method of interpreting all other problems generated
by the functions of the human instincts and
emotions.</p>

I have proven that the individual, as representative
of our modern culture, finds it impossible to maintain
his bisexuality; therefore he represses either his
homosexuality or his heterosexuality. We also
convinced ourselves that organic bisexuality has
nothing to do with psychic bisexuality. <em>Hirschfeld</em>
expressly emphasizes that he has met with homosexuality
among strongly virile men and among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>persons typically female. The organic theory of
homosexuality has broken down completely. One
would suppose that the investigators would necessarily
turn to the psychologic concept. No. The
psychic forces are still underestimated and the
heterosexual period of homosexuals is still overlooked.
Although <em>Hirschfeld</em> emphasizes that to
psychoanalysis belongs the merit of having pointed
out first the heterosexual component, why does he
not draw the natural deductions from this acknowledged
fact? He arrives at the following conclusions:</p>

<p class='c003'>1. Genuine homosexuality is always an inborn
condition.</p>

<p class='c004'>2. This inborn state is conditioned by a specific
homosexual constitution of the brain.</p>

<p class='c004'>3. That specific brain structure is brought about
through a peculiar mixed condition of male and
female hereditary plasm.</p>

<p class='c004'>4. That ambisexual state is found frequently
associated with pronounced instability of the nervous
system.</p>

<p class='c004'>5. Between the specific and the nervous constitution
there exists an intimate relationship.</p>

<p class='c004'>6. All external causes are operative only in the
presence of the inner homosexual constitution.</p>

<p class='c004'>7. External causes—provocative—are so common
that in 99 per cent. of cases the innate homosexual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>disposition breaks forth sooner or later and
becomes clearly manifest in consciousness.</p>

<p class='c004'>8. Homosexuality is neither a morbidity nor a
degeneration; it is neither a taint nor a criminal
trait, representing merely an aspect of natural development,
a sexual variant, like many analogous
sexual modifications in the animal and vegetal
world. (<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hirschfeld, Homosexualität</span></cite>, p. 394.)</p>

<p class='c003'>Our data do not uphold these contentions. How
can <em>Hirschfeld</em> speak of an innate homosexual constitution
when elsewhere in his work he admits the
constant presence of heterosexual instincts? How
can he maintain that homosexuality is a trait reaching
back to the very roots of individuality when
every careful investigation proves the contrary?</p>

<p class='c004'>The following statements show his contradictions
on the subject:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Here too it has been contended that all these
deviations from the sexual type during childhood
and puberty do not conclusively lead to the diagnosis
of homosexuality, that the earlier periods of life are
undifferentiated with respect to sex, that boys as
well as girls, young men as well as young women,
often become eventually fully heterosexual in spite
of pronounced androgyny and sexual incongruities;
even the transvestites of both sexes show early traits
inharmonious with their respective sex, and certainly
many passivists, succubists, or masochists show
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>themselves already as boys somewhat lacking in
‘mannish’ traits while female activists, incubists and
sadists lack certain womanly traits already in their
girlhood, though all retain the capacity to love the
opposite sex and therefore prove themselves later
heterosexual....</p>

<p class='c004'>“At any rate one thing is certain. If a child
is a urning, it grows up a heterosexual person with
the same unconditional certainty with which the
‘normal’ child becomes heterosexual. Thus the special
character of the urning looms forth as something
fundamental having its roots in the depths
of personality.” (<em>Hirschfeld, Homosexualität</em>, p.
121.)</p>

<p class='c003'>Naturally, <em>Hirschfeld</em> adopts a safe method of
excluding all cases which do present a history of
heterosexuality. He calls such cases “pseudohomosexuality”
thus placing them in a category
apart from the genuine urning. <em>Bloch</em> also calls
the heterosexual inclination of typical homosexuals
a sort of “pseudoheterosexuality.”<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> This method
of dealing with the subject admits of no proofs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span><em>Bloch</em> suggests the test that a genuine theory of
homosexuality must be capable of embracing all
cases. The <em>Hirschfeld</em> theory of “the third sex” cannot
do so. It is neither founded nor proven either
on organic or on psychologic grounds.</p>

<p class='c004'>But why is it that the homosexual shifts so completely
away from the sexual partner? <em>A. Adler</em>
has conceived in these cases the hypothesis of a
“<em>fear of the sexual partner</em>.” This observation certainly
holds true in the case of many homosexuals,
but is not true of all cases. Nature does not operate
in such simple ways and a single key does not
unlock the riddle of homosexuality.</p>

<p class='c004'>In accordance with the results of our investigation
thus far we may conclude: the homosexual finds
closed for him the path which leads to the other sex,
and the barrier is psychical. Anxiety, disgust and
scorn support the forces of homosexual love. These
feelings do not exhaust the range of inhibitory factors
and we shall presently turn our attention to
others. But we must take up the psychogenesis of
these inhibitions in a thorough and systematic
manner.</p>

<p class='c004'>May fear of the sexual partner drive a person into
homosexuality? We must answer this question in
the affirmative inasmuch as we are able to trace that
fear in a number of cases.</p>

<p class='c004'>First, let us take up the case of <em>Krafft-Ebing</em>
(Obs. 159) since it is so simple and obvious:</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>54. Mrs. X., 26 years of age, married 7 years,
confesses herself attracted for some time to persons
of her own sex; she respects and even feels a
certain sympathy for her husband but marital relations
with him she finds repulsive. She has made
him abstain from sexual relations with her since
the birth of their youngest child. Already at the
boarding school she felt a keen interest in other
young women, which she can only describe as
love attraction. <em>But occasionally she had also felt
herself attracted to particular men and lately a certain
man had put her resistance to test. She was
often afraid she might forget herself with him and
therefore avoided being alone with the man.</em> But
these are merely passing episodes in contrast with
her passionate inclination towards persons of her
own sex. Her true love is expressed in kisses, caresses
and intimate contact with the latter. Failure
to gratify that yearning is painfully uncomfortable
and is largely responsible for her present
nervous state. The subject does not assume a particular
sexual rôle in relation to persons of her own
sex, and she did no more than indulge with them in
kisses, petting and embracing. The subject considers
herself of a passionate nature. Quite likely
that she masturbates. Her sexual perversion she
looks upon as “unnaturally morbid.” Nothing in
the woman’s ordinary conduct or external appearance
betrays such an anomaly. About her childhood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>she is unable to report anything of significance.
She was quick to learn, had poetic and
æsthetic inclinations, was considered somewhat nervous,
loved reading of novels and sentimental romances,
was of a neuropathic constitution, and extremely
sensitive to changes in temperature. It is
noteworthy also that at ten years of age, because
she thought that her mother did not love her, the
patient dissolved matches in coffee and <em>drank the
solution so as to make herself very ill and to draw
her mother’s affection to her</em>.</p>

<p class='c003'>Here we see an inclination to heterosexual relations
which is not cultivated on account of fear.
This young woman, with a tremendous homosexual
leaning as shown already by her attachment to her
mother, marries a man, in whose embrace she remains
frigid, but fears to be alone with a man who
rouses her, because he may prove dangerous to her.
We see that her pronounced bisexuality leads her
to fall in love with a man, to be his sweetheart, in
her fancy, but she hesitates to turn her fancy into
a reality, the “fear of sinning” preventing her from
carrying out the step. Then she looks upon the
heterosexual inclinations as passing whims and turns
to her homosexual fancies. She is running away
from the male. She fears the man she loves because
a strong love implies submission to the male.
She gravitates away from him, not because the male
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>is unable to yield her gratification but because she
fears him. But we must understand how this flight
from the male, which manifests itself also in her
dyspareunia, originated. How little such life histories
bear on this point, without psychoanalysis!
In my study of dyspareunia<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a> I describe similar
cases and show how aversion towards the male originates
in the first place.</p>

<p class='c004'>Through <em>Freud</em> we have learned that fear, like
disgust, is a repressed form of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">libido</span></i>. Though this
view is correct, it is not always adequate. My own
researches have shown that every fear represents
in the first place fear of self.</p>

<p class='c004'>But why should the homosexual entertain any
fear of himself during intercourse with woman?
What he fears is his excessive sexuality when it is
commingled with criminal tendencies.</p>

<p class='c004'>The frequency with which fear of one’s own criminal
aggressiveness stands back of impotence and
homosexuality can hardly be overestimated. <em>Krafft-Ebing</em>
describes a typical bisexual who had experienced
orgasm but once in contact with woman. But
that happened during the commission of a delict
(<em>Obs.</em> 142, p. 273) on his part.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is remarkable that he did experience gratification
that one time during the (forced) act. After
the act he was overcome with nausea. One hour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>after the assault he again had coitus with the same
woman and with her consent but that time he no
longer experienced any satisfaction.” That proves
that the orgasm depended on his abuse of force.
The fear is fear of violence, the disgust is disgust
of self, both coming into play so as to protect
one against deeds incompatible with one’s ethical
standards.</p>

<p class='c004'>I know a large number of homosexuals who have
actually confessed to me that they are able to have
intercourse with women only while they are in a
strong rage. But then they are in fear of themselves,
so dangerous do they become. One subject
confessed to me that he had nearly strangled his
sexual partner. Other homosexuals feel an inexpressible
rage just after coitus. In such cases the
heterosexual act is associatively related to some
criminal act. Some unconscious fancies depict and
urge cutting up, strangling or beating the female
companion. These men are extreme woman-haters
and hatred is always deadly.</p>

<p class='c004'>I reproduce here a single relevant observation:</p>

<p class='c003'>55. Mr. H. K. is a well-known homosexual who
prefers particularly males of low standing. The
more powerfully built the men are the greater is
his orgasm. He prefers to choose packers, furniture
movers, expressmen and generally individuals
of strong build. His greatest orgasm he experienced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>during intimacy with a member of an athletic
club, a man who had a very small penis. He feels
such a strong fear of women that he does not trust
himself in a room alone with one. He does not
remember having ever been sensuously stirred by a
woman. Several times he tried intercourse with
prostitutes but fled each time as soon as he found
himself alone in the room with the woman. A cold
sweat breaks out over his brow and he runs off precipitately
as if pursued by a thousand demons. A
short analysis over a few days revealed that this
was a typical case of a criminal fancy, the subject
having indulged for a long time in the onanistic
fancy of strangling a woman. (“All women ought
to be exterminated”&#160;... is a favorite sentiment
often expressed by this man.) In his phantasies
he has also committed assaults on men, and the
thought of ripping open the anus of a man has
occurred to him already several times.</p>

<p class='c004'>His fear of women is the fear he may forget himself
and strangle one of them. But he is also afraid
of men, that is, he also fears he may commit some
assault on a man. Therefore he protects himself
through choosing men of powerful physique. They
should be stronger than he. Thus he feels assured
that he will not be able to assault them. Lately he
has been seeking a mannish woman who should also
be stronger than he. Evidently he proposes to protect
himself also in that case&#160;... against himself.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>The homosexuality showed itself to be a flight from
his criminal heterosexual tendencies.</p>

<p class='c003'>Other homosexuals protect themselves against
woman through disgust. How closely hatred, fear,
and disgust stand in this connection may be seen
in the following observation by <em>Hirschfeld</em>:</p>

<p class='c003'>“A certain homosexual related to me that he is
able to have intercourse with a woman but that immediately
afterwards he is seized with a terrible
anger against the woman and once after the act he
spat at her in disgust; since that, in order to avoid
consequences, he leaves the room as hastily as possible
immediately after the ejaculation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How far the aversion may go is shown by the
case of the homosexual <em>Herzog von Praslin-Choiseul</em>
who at Paris in 1864 strangled <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post coitum</span></i> his
young bride, the daughter of <em>General Sebastiani</em>.
It may be mentioned in this connection that by far
the greater number of sadistic women who prevail
upon masochistic males of grossest physical and
mental type to carry out acts of violence upon them
are in reality homosexual women with a sexual aversion
to men. Professor <em>Albert Eulenburg</em> told me
that all the alleged sadists among females whom
he knows have proven themselves in reality to be
homosexuals. I, too, know but three women among
twelve sadists who deny homosexuality.” (<em>Hirschfeld</em>,
<em>loc. cit.</em> p. 96).</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>First we learn that this homosexual, through fear
of himself, runs off in the nick of time. The act of
spitting may be the symbolic substitute for a more
serious act. If additional testimony were needed
to support the relevance of my conception, the case
of the <em>Duke von Praslin-Choiseul</em> stands forth as the
clearest proof one could wish. Plainly <em>Hirschfeld</em>,
as usual, confuses here cause and effect. The <em>Duke
did not strangle his bride because he was homosexual,—he
had taken flight in homosexuality, because
he felt impelled to commit a “passion crime”
and he tried to protect himself against his own wild
instincts</em>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Particularly interesting from the criminologic-psychologic
standpoint are the cases of epileptics
who during the attack are diverted from their usual
sexual path. The epileptic is a criminal who during
the attack carries out some criminal deed. Ordinarily
the deed is carried out in the phantasy, but
here and there the epileptic commits overtly some
deed of uncommon cruelty. During his epileptic
attack the patient gives expression to his criminal
trend. The attack is the equivalent of the crime.
Readers interested in this important problem I must
refer to my original study.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a> I have been much
surprised that it has received so little attention on
the part of neurologists and criminologists. It is
the fate of psychoanalysts. The current fashion in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>science has decreed our ban, our works are overlooked
and are neglected even when they are of fundamental
significance, like my contribution on
epilepsy.</p>

<p class='c004'>Epilepsy, with the exception of the Jacksonian
type, is a particular form of hysteria. In the
hysterical attack, too, the unconscious forces break
through and the individual carries out various instinctive
promptings while his consciousness is side-tracked.
The epileptic attack represents more the
criminal, the hysterical corresponds more to the
sexual urge. Naturally the epileptic attack may
also substitute some sexual crime (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crime passionelle</span></i>),
and that, frequently, is the theme of the attack. It
is thus obvious that homosexuals who shun crimes
of passion may fall easily a victim to attacks during
which the crimes are carried out vicariously. In
our study of sadism we shall analyze in detail such
a case.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Here I wish to point out merely the
interesting fact that during the epileptic attack
heterosexuals commit homosexual acts and reversely.</p>

<p class='c003'>56. Mr. W. H., 39 years of age, a strongly built
young man, comes to me to be treated for epilepsy
and every time he is accompanied by an attendant.
Since his 16th year he suffers attacks and several
times he was seized while on the street. For that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>reason he does not go out alone and is always accompanied
by his attendant, a simple fellow to whom
he seems much attached. He is totally incapacitated
from following any occupation for it turns
out that his attacks are more frequent when he
endeavors to work. On account of his attacks he
has prevailed upon his well-to-do father to keep
him in the country where he has nothing to do but
to go on walks. He is soft and pliant so long as
things go his way. But if contradicted he flies into
great rage. He does not burst out with anger but
tries to control himself and soon afterwards he has
an attack during which he sees red. He reproaches
himself a great deal on account of his failure to
achieve something in life and because he is the
cause of so much trouble to his parents. His ethical
standard is a very high one and that is a point
of great significance in the differential diagnosis of
genuine epilepsy. He bemoans his misspent life and
wants to be cured. If only there were some way
to free him of the trouble! Regarding his sexual
life: he relates that he is decidedly homosexual and
that boys and handsome young men particularly
attract him. The attendant is clearly a protection
against his homosexual excitations. When he meets
boys who attract him he clings to his attendant
pretending to fear an oncoming attack. While living
in the country at the present his attacks come
on only at night and in bed. He does not recall the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">aura</span></i>, except that he sees red, and he remembers no
dream starting or accompanying the attack. He
masturbates occasionally; always with the fancy
that he is playing with small boys. I suggest to his
parents that he ought to be psychoanalyzed. In
view of the hopeless character of other current
therapy this may be his only chance of recovery.
The father agrees. But as the patient lives some
distance from Vienna I advise the father to remove
him to the city for the duration of the treatment.
This he also agrees to do. Next day the mother
calls and asks me to use my influence to prevent the
boy from staying in Vienna. That would bring him
back home and she is tremendously afraid of him.
Her husband does not know it, she has kept it from
him. During the attacks the son turns on her and
attempts to attack her. Once she succeeded to repel
him only by the exercise of her strength. During
the attack he rolls his eyes fearfully and
threatens she must die because she is responsible for
everything. I arrange that the patient should see
me only twice a week after that. But on the third
appointment he failed to appear, because I had
stipulated as one of the first conditions of my treatment
that he must go to work. The very next day
he reacted with several attacks. The father found
that the treatment proved “too exciting” for the
boy, and I agreed readily to give up the analysis
when the father took entirely the son’s side and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>disagreed with the suggestion that the boy must
take up some occupation.</p>

<p class='c003'>This case shows the outbreak of homosexuality
during the attacks and an affective relationship to
the mother such as is shown by many homosexuals,
as we shall explain more fully later.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reverse also happens,—heterosexuals committing
homosexual deeds during the attacks. The
repressed components of sexuality always break
through during the attack.</p>

<p class='c004'><em>Tarnowsky</em>, too, speaks of “<em>epileptic pederasty</em>.”<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
The “epileptic pederasts” are usually of
active character. As an example he mentions the
case of a criminal who came under his personal observation.
A young man, wealthy, apparently fully
heterosexual, goes to the house of his beloved after
a sumptuous dinner during which he had imbibed
a great amount of wine. The lady of the house
not being at home he went to a room where a 14-year-old
boy was asleep, assaulted him and also
the chamber maid who ran to the spot attracted by
the boy’s outcries. After that he fell into a sleep
which lasted 12 hours. When he awoke he recalled
nothing of the episode. It was found that he was
subject to epileptic attacks particularly after wine.
<em>Hirschfeld</em> observes in this connection:</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“Usually the epileptic neurosis—which, as a matter
of fact, I have noticed but rarely among homosexuals—influences
homosexuality in the sense of
removing the inhibitions and increasing the impulsive
energy of the instinctive cravings. I have had
under examination a particularly serious case of
this character, a man-servant, subject to epilepsy
who during a fit of rage and anger strangled to
death and then hacked to pieces a boy. In this, as
in similar cases, there was a previous history of a
fusion of homosexuality and epilepsy. At any rate
it is conceivable that during the beclouding of consciousness
induced by the epileptic seizure all
psychic factors undergo such a complete transformation
that even tendencies ordinarily wholly
foreign to consciousness and not even tolerated in
the foreconscious, insofar as the latter may be revealed,
find ready outlet. <em>Burchard</em>, too, has observed
an epileptic of normal sexuality who during
the seizures committed homosexual assaults on other
patients.” (<em>Hirschfeld</em>, <em>loc. cit.</em>, p. 214.)</p>

<p class='c003'>What I have said about the influence of alcoholics
holds true also of epileptic attacks. The latter
also neutralize the inhibitions and the bisexual and
criminal aspects of human nature come clearly to
surface. It is noteworthy that <em>Tarnowsky’s</em> patient
also indulged in alcohol before the onset of
the attack.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>The following case shows that the attacks may
also be simulated:</p>

<p class='c003'>57. Mr. Z. T., a bisexual, subject to anxiety
attacks, relates that he suffered a great deal once
because his mother devoted herself very lovingly
to a brother during the latter’s illness. He was 22
years of age at the time and extremely jealous.
Once he found himself alone in the room with his
mother. Without knowing what he was doing he
threw himself on her with the intent of assaulting
her. The mother shouted and the sisters and servants
came rushing in. He simulated an epileptic
fit, threw himself on the floor and remained for an
hour apparently in a faint. Physicians were called
in and they declared the condition epilepsy. For
two days he acted as if he heard nothing of what
was said and knew nothing of what was going on.
His deed caused him endless shame. He was not
reproached on account of it and he spent two months
in a comfortable sanatorium.</p>

<p class='c004'>How closely related are make-believe and illness
with every neurotic! This young man suffered also
from fear and disgust of women but that, as well as
his whole anxiety neurosis, disappeared completely
under psychoanalytic treatment. The case stands
as one of my most successful therapeutic accomplishments.</p>

<p class='c004'>We turn our attention now to a consideration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>of the disgust with which homosexuals are inspired
by the other sex. I have already repeatedly stated
that the disgust represents a repressed desire, that
it stands for the repulsion of unbearable tendencies.
Heterosexuals show a similar aversion for their own
sex,—a feeling which the homosexuals have repressed.
That much the very beginner in psychoanalysis
knows; the observation belongs to the <em>a b c</em>
of practical psychology. Nevertheless, we still find
disgust and scorn of woman pointed out as proofs
of homosexuality. Disgust is not a proof of the
absence of the proper <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">libido</span></i>. The true homosexuals
would show a complete indifference towards the
opposite sex. Occasionally they do assume such indifference
for their attitude is always affective
and negativistic. <em>Hirschfeld</em> contradicts himself
repeatedly on this point.</p>

<p class='c004'>In one place he emphasizes that the genuine homosexual
is indifferent towards woman and shows no
disgust:</p>

<p class='c003'>“On this point also I find myself in agreement
with <em>Numa Praetorius</em>,<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a> who in one of his essays
remarks that most persons ‘show an inclination
towards one sex but only indifference towards the
other sex.’ He is of the opinion that the disgust
of heterosexuals’ feeling-attitude of disgust towards
homosexual deeds, too, is an intellectual process induced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>by the prevailing social attitude and judgment
rather than instinctive and innate. If the dislike
were genuine heterosexuals would hardly get
along so easily and so often with homosexuals nor
would the latter carry on so readily masturbatory
acts with the opposite sex, even though the acts be
limited to mechanical excitations.” (<em>Hirschfeld</em>,
<em>loc. cit.</em>, p. 218.)</p>

<p class='c003'>But another passage of the work reveals the opposite
view:</p>

<p class='c003'>“A 26-year-old workingman relates: ‘At 17 years
of age an older friend of mine induced me once to
have sexual intercourse with a woman—I was unaware
at the time of my <em>urning disposition</em>—and I
felt such disgust that I vomited. Since that time I
have a “holy horror” of any contact with woman,
until a few weeks ago when driven to despair I tried
to control myself. It was useless, I could attain
neither erection nor ejaculation and instead, the
continuous irritation brought on an inflammation
of the member.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A Bavarian merchant relates: ‘As a result of
repeated intercourse with women I have acquired a
serious nervous derangement, a strong sense of lassitude
associated with vomiting and migraine lasting
for days. The odor exhaled by woman causes
me greatest distress. I am now unable to gratify a
woman, but on the other hand contact with a soldier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>makes me happy, it strengthens and revives
me.’” (<em>Hirschfeld</em>, <em>loc. cit.</em>, p. 96.)</p>

<p class='c003'>In the passage next following he expresses himself
even more plainly:</p>

<p class='c003'>“It is very striking to note that women in executive
positions, directresses, etc., are much more severe
with the male employees, servants, etc., than
with the female personnel. There are homosexual
males who avoid any service by women and chiefly
for that reason dislike restaurants employing female
waitresses. Also, there are homosexual women
who avoid business relations with men for similar
reasons. Without knowing why, homosexually predisposed
girls begin early to feel that being conducted
home by gentlemen is something superfluous
as well as unpleasant. Many <em>urnings</em> and <em>urlinds</em>
actually experience a physical distress when some
member of the opposite sex so much as helps them
on with their coat. <em>I know several homosexual
physicians of extreme sensitiveness whose aversion
to the female characters is so strong that physical
examinations of women, particularly of their sexual
parts or breasts, is highly repulsive to them and the
aversion may go so far as to make it impossible for
them to undertake such an examination.</em>” (<em>Hirschfeld</em>,
<em>loc. cit.</em>, p. 98.)</p>

<p class='c003'>Such accounts prove that the attitude of the
homosexual towards the opposite sex is not one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>indifference. Where that is claimed it may be
doubted; at any rate it does not correspond with
psychoanalytic experience. Hatred, anger, disgust,
physical discomfort serve as protections against the
other sex. That is true of male as well as of the
female homosexuals.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a short space I shall now limit my observations
to male homosexuals. I shall attempt to make
clear how I have arrived at my present conception.
<em>The homosexual’s scorn of woman, his emotional
revulsion-attitude against the other sex, is precisely
what led me to formulate my new conceptions.</em> I
had the opportunity to analyze a homosexual. During
the very first consultation hours there was revealed
that heterosexual stage through which every
homosexual must pass. Previously it was my custom
to refuse to analyze homosexuals because I had
assumed <em>Hirschfeld’s</em> view that <em>uranism</em> is an innate
condition. This particular patient suffered of various
anxiety attacks and came to be treated for his
anxiety not for his homosexuality. His anxiety
state showed itself particularly as a fear of woman
so that he could not trust himself to be alone with
one. Among his acquaintances there was also a
very sympathetic spinster. They went on walks
together for hours but his fear still dominated him
and he could never trust himself with her alone
in a room. They held their conversations either in
a public garden or at a restaurant. Naturally I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>looked into this anxiety condition and began to investigate
this homosexual who had maintained relations
with an elderly gentleman for years, with reference
to his heterosexuality. I was surprised when
he brought forth countless heterosexual reminiscences
from his childhood. During the first few
days I heard the usual history of <em>urnings</em>: the liking
for girls’ games, womanly behavior, he had
always been more like a girl in everything, etc. But
soon the picture changed and the heterosexual tendency
became gradually more evident. His dependence
on the attachment to the mother was striking.
One-sided as my attitude was at the time, I made
certain deductions, somewhat hastily, regarding the
roots of homosexuality, and in the first edition of
my <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Angstzustände</span></cite> (1908), after several similar
experiences, I wrote:</p>

<p class='c003'>“As is shown by my latest investigations these
cases are frequently neuroses. Some time homosexuality
improves or may disappear under psychoanalysis.
Homosexuality represents merely the
complete revulsion of infantile incestuous thoughts.
Homosexual males never experience any erotic feeling
in contact with a strange woman; they confess
that they can feel towards these women only as
towards a sister or the mother. That discloses to
us the roots of homosexuality. The concept ‘woman’
is unalterably fused with the concepts ‘mother’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>and ‘sister.’ The <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Abwehr</span></i> of incestuous fancies determines
the flight into homosexuality. That transposition
naturally is facilitated through corresponding
somatic changes. The homosexual, too, is a victim
of infantile reminiscences. Thus homosexuality
turns out to be but a special form of the neurotic
repression.”</p>

<p class='c003'>With youthful impetuosity I formulated the results
of my investigations somewhat hastily at the
time and expressed the therapeutic results in too
optimistic a tone. In the course of time I learned
to know better. Many patients who considered
themselves cured were only improved and stuck to
their <em>uranism</em>. We shall have to speak of that with
full particulars.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the present I must consider more fully the
theme “mother and homosexuality.” The relationship
between the two I had originally conceived according
to the Freudian formula. I did not see at
the time the influence of other forces, such as I have
already pointed out here. The earliest dream of
my first homosexual, for instance, was about a
murder, the victim being a woman; I did not understand
that dream. I did not know that the fear of
woman stood for the fear of criminal tendencies,
that the subject was a sadist who had saved himself
through homosexuality from committing some
regrettable deed. These impulses accompanied the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>incest phantasies which were unusually strong and
of which he was fully aware long before analysis.
The latter were merely pushed out of consciousness
as unbearable. A short time later <em>Sadger</em> published
his first analysis of a homosexual and in that
contribution he formulated the thesis that like every
other neurosis homosexuality arises during the
fourth year and that the task of analysis, therefore,
must be to reach back to the fourth year.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'><em>Sadger</em> emphasized: “From the very first I assumed
that the homosexual tendencies may be acquired
only if they are formed during the first four
years, precisely as in the case of hysteria and compulsive
neurosis and that psychoanalysis ought to
uncover the fact. What stood beyond psychoanalysis
must be innate and corresponds to the sexual
constitution proper.”</p>

<p class='c004'>That work, extremely one-sided and full of contradictions,
still attempts to reduce homosexuality
to the love of the father. The mother plays a
limited rôle. It is mentioned passingly that the subject
of the analysis had never loved a being so
dearly as the mother; but even before the mother’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>death an aunt had attracted to herself the boy’s
love.</p>

<p class='c004'>But what are the conclusions drawn by <em>Sadger</em>
from the case? None whatever! He is pleased that
he has been able to bring to light such interesting
material but knows not what to do with it. Among
the various questions and answers there is a very
significant passage suggesting an important conclusion.
Concerning his attachment to the mother
the subject states: “<em>And my love arose chiefly
through compassion, because father drank a great
deal lately and paid attention to other women and
mother often wept and that made me feel badly.</em>”</p>

<p class='c004'>That is a fact which I have had occasion frequently
to corroborate. The children of drinkers
and “woman-chasers” turn easily homosexual, in
the endeavor to be unlike the father. They then
hate woman and scorn everything that the father
liked in particular. They become abstinent and try
to behave contrary to the father in every respect.</p>

<p class='c003'><em>Sadger’s</em> patient actually points out this tendency.
He states: “Father clearly had no homosexual
inclination as he was a great admirer of
women. From the time he began telling me about
the school—he was particularly fond of French
women—he also advised me to marry only a French
woman and showed me French pictures and the
photos of various French women. It was thus instilled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>in me that I ought to marry a French woman.”
And what did the father accomplish thereby?
Was it jealousy or pity and love for the mother?
The father accomplished the contrary of what he
set out to do. Instead of obedience he was met
with spite. The subject relates: “Later when I became
aware of my homosexual inclinations, <em>everything
French-like was particularly hateful to me,
especially the French women, I no longer liked the
French language or anything whatever related to
French</em>....”</p>

<p class='c003'>The subject had a pronounced fear of marriage,
having seen a sad example of it in his own home.
He dreams of getting married, a minister is about
to perform the ceremony, and he is so unhappy in
the midst of it that upon awakening his happiness
knows no bounds. He fears every great passion.
“I am afraid of a really tremendous love, because
such a passion always makes me unhappy.” The
analysis discloses other relations to the father
which are of greatest significance.</p>

<p class='c004'>The feeling-attitude in question dates in fact
from the earliest childhood. As yet we are ignorant
of child nature and we do not fully appreciate that
the fundamental traits of life show themselves very
definitely during early childhood. This boy must
have conceived early the thought: <em>I must not be like
the father!</em> and so he turned away from women because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>the father was an admirer of that sex.
Whether this choice of attitude was also influenced
directly by love for the father I am unable to assert
in that particular case. It seems to play a contributory
rôle and greatly denied love may enhance
the child’s attachment to the mother. <em>But does not
the example of a drinking “woman-chaser” contrasted
to the picture of a quiet suffering mother
seem to be enough to induce the differentiation and
to maintain it as its underlying determining motive?</em>
Back of the homosexuality of the first case
of the kind analyzed by <em>Sadger</em> stands the subject’s
fear of becoming like his father. The violent fancies
disclosed in the course of the analysis show that
there are also other reasons for the subject’s fear
of woman. He is so constituted that he cannot see
blood. This peculiarity denotes the conversion of
a craving for violence and signifies a repressed
sadism.</p>

<p class='c004'>In Russia he once witnessed how a man split his
wife’s head open with a stone.... The occurrence
so impressed him that he could never get it out of
his mind, and he also likes to dwell on wars and
other bloody scenes.</p>

<p class='c004'>There can be no doubt the man is a sadist and
that with reference to women in particular. He
has full reason to fear woman. His fear is fear of
himself. He must turn to man, towards whom he
does not feel the instinctive sexual hatred which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>makes heterosexual excitations impossible for him.
When he has intercourse with a woman, he feels
subsequently a tremendous disgust and revulsion,
the whole thing seems to him unnatural. In the
end he gives up all such attempts.</p>

<p class='c004'>Obviously he is all the time seeking a kindly preeminent
father for he falls in love with an elderly
philosopher, out of respect for philosophy, as he
paralogizes, because he looks to philosophy to redeem
him from his suffering. The differentiation is
an attempt at gaining freedom, a tendency to overcome
the nature of the father. The love of the
philosopher is a substitution for the love of the
father.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus we see the importance of the early life history
of every subject for the understanding of
homosexuality. The constellation of childhood permits
the reading of the horoscope for the future.
Perhaps this uncontrovertible truth contains the
root of all astrologic art, “the planetary laws governing
the facts of life.” The father as the sun,
the mother as the milder moon and the children, the
stars. Our fate arranges itself in accordance with
the constellation of these planets. Blind accident
and innate forces cooperate to create man as he is.</p>

<p class='c004'>But let us look further into the investigations of
<em>Sadger</em> to whom the credit must not be denied of
having applied himself earnestly to the attempt of
solving the problem of homosexuality.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>His next publication appeared also in 1908.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
Here we find clearly taken into account the infantile
heterosexual attitude which all homosexuals
usually forget but which always precedes genuine
homosexuality.</p>

<p class='c003'>“The young student, 21 years of age at the time,
was sent to me, because he was tormented by various
homosexual inclinations, especially directed towards
young boys 14–20 years of age, associated
with all sorts of masochistic feelings. In contact
with woman (a prostitute with whom he sought intercourse
three times till then, the first two times
spontaneously, to see whether he is at all potent,
the third time, on medical advice as well as upon
his father’s insistence) he found himself entirely
<em>impotent</em>. Questioned whether he ever felt any inclination
towards the opposite sex, he only recalls
that when he was two or three years of age he once
opened the garden gate for a girl of about his own
age, with a flourish of extreme gallantry. Concerning
any hereditary factors he can only relate
that a brother of his mother’s had some mental
trouble. The mother herself seemed to have something
boy-like and manly about her, on the other
hand the father showed very little sensuousness and
rather pronounced inverted traits, while a sister,
who died early, had a <em>very boy-like facial expression</em>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>She preferred boyish games and at 4 or 5 years of
age she chose a boy’s hobby horse for her Christmas
present. Some female cousins—on mother’s as
well as on father’s side—were clearly amphigenously
inverted. The subject himself had unusually
broad hips and the growth of his facial hair was
noticeably scant. As a child he is supposed to have
played only with dolls, never with soldiers, he never
took part in boys’ games and he also learned embroidery.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Plainly a clear case of inversion with masochistic
traits. What was revealed through the
analysis of this particularly intelligent subject? In
the first place, a remarkable peculiarity: <em>his earliest
inclinations were directed towards women,—not
some one in particular, but a number of them. His
first beloved was the mother</em> and, of course, after a
time he turned away from her. After that he felt
himself tremendously attracted to an elderly mother
of children, proposed marriage to her and that woman
later figured in many of his pubertal coitus
dreams. Next he displayed such an extreme gallantry
towards a girl of his own age that it became
very noticeable and his mother spoke to him
about it and he felt very ashamed and uneasy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“During his childhood a servant maid also had
made a deep impression on his feelings and she reappears
in various male types. Among the homosexual
inclinations traceable to the first years I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>look upon his attachment to a couple of uncles as
the strongest and most significant, next the love
of a 9-year-old boy belonging to the nobility
(baron). In his fourth year the attachment to a
boy who taught him masturbation, in his sixth and
seventh years the influence of a private teacher.
During his fourth year, on account of his mother’s
condition, following childbirth, he slept for a time
with his father in one bed and this suggested various
homosexual wishes and fancies. When a little
sister came into the world <em>he promptly fell in love
with her</em>. Even more striking is the subject’s normal
sexual calf-love affairs in his seventh and
eighth years with three or four schoolgirl mates of
about his age. It turned out that each one of these
girls contributed some traits to the types, both
male and female, which later were alone capable of
rousing his emotional interest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“<em>These facts, of which the subject was entirely
unconscious and which had to be brought to surface
after months of diligent analysis, yield an entirely
new picture.</em> First of all they show us how little
even the most intelligent person knows himself, and,
consequently, how careful we must be in accepting
even the most candid statements. Secondly,—that
even pure cases of inversion do not exclude the
presence of normal sexual inclinations, indeed, that
the latter may actually be present, though the subject
be unaware of the fact. Thirdly,—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>finally,—that the inversion is traceable as far back
as the fourth year although it may reach consciousness
only during puberty.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Here already I must point out the first contradiction.
It is not a fact that the inversion is traceable
back to the fourth year. I have analyzed a
number of cases in which the inversion arose after
puberty and much later. The beginnings of the
homosexual disposition reach into childhood with
all persons. This turning away from the other sex
may break forth early in some cases and in others
much later. <em>But it is a fact that every analysis
discloses the heterosexual trait which the homosexuals
forget, or speaking more correctly, repress,
because it does not appear to fit into their system.</em>
Analytically this case of <em>Sadger’s</em> seems to me to be
an instance of fixation upon the sister. The boys
are substitutes for the sister. We will give the
histories of several such cases. He who understands
the neurotic’s art of metamorphosing his ideals, he
who has learned through their dreams to appreciate
this trick of substitution, will readily appreciate
that a girl may be loved through falling in
love with a boy. It is related of <em>Platen</em> that he
possessed a marvelous phantasy. For a long time
a colleague was changed for him into an owl whom
he avoided on the way. In Neapel he kept for days
a cat on his lap pretending it was an enchanted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>princess. Genuine fetichism shows to what unbelievable
metamorphoses the sexual ideal is subjected.
With the homosexuals to find a boy who stands as
symbol for self or for a sister is a common experience.
Like all neurotics they do not possess the
capacity to distinguish between the world of fancy
and that of reality. I have called neurosis <em>the
tyranny of symbolisms</em>. This is particularly true
of the neurotic who becomes homosexual. All
values are transformed, the object becomes subject
and vice versa. In the midst of this transformation
of all facts one thing remains fast and true:
the infantile ideal which is yearned for with the persistence
generated by the eternally ungratified
craving.</p>

<p class='c003'>In his next contribution <em>Sadger</em> reports the results
of the analysis of an invert during a period of
six months (<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zur Ætiologie der konträren Sexualempfindung</span></cite>,
Med. Klinik, 1909, No. 2). The special
preference of his patient for passive pederasty
he traces to the frequent use of enemas during childhood.
(In fact it seems to me that the many unnecessary
enemas administered during early childhood
may contribute towards the fixation of the
anus as an erogenous zone.) He also traces out in
this case the repressed heterosexuality. “The vacillations
of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">libido</span></i> between male and female are
like the facial innervation which, as is well known,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>is based on the equilibrium between the muscles innervated
simultaneously by the pair of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">facialis</span></i>
nerves. Paralysis of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">facialis</span></i> nerve on one side
causes not only weakness of the muscles on the affected
side but induces also contractures of the
muscles on the opposite side.” The patient referred
to was attached exclusively to his father,
who, himself somewhat homosexually inclined, won
the child’s heart through his excessive tenderness,
in contrast to the rather severe mother. During
his fourth year, on account of the mother’s pregnant
state, he slept with his father, an occurrence
to which <em>Sadger</em> attaches great significance. The
objects of the boy’s homosexual attachments bore
some resemblance to the beloved sister. He weaned
himself away from his attachment to his mother
during his fifteenth year, when he saw his mother
deformed with a tremendous ascites on account of
which she had to be tapped a number of times. Her
appearance at the time filled him with disgust for
all women. As over-determination of this feeling-attitude
of aversion he recalls the following: after
the puerperium referred to above his mother had a
profuse leucorrheal discharge which the boy, already
sensitive to all scents—he was four years of
age at the time—found very repulsive whenever he
approached his mother. The subject also recalls
vividly how his mother repulsed his aggressive ways
with her, between his 3rd and 6th year. (“He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>always wanted to grab her by the breasts and tried
to go to her room and to the bathroom as soon as
she went in.”)</p>

<p class='c004'>Much as physicians unacquainted with infantile
sexuality may ignore such aggressions they do take
place and some mothers have verified them for me.
On the other hand it is hardly likely that a child
four years of age should be repelled from the mother
on account of scent. At that early age scent is
rather a stimulant and is never accompanied by
disgust.</p>

<p class='c004'>I turn now to the last and most comprehensive
deductions formulated by <em>Sadger</em> in his study entitled:
<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ein Fall von multipler perversion mit hysterischen
Absenzen</span></cite> (‘A case of multiple perversions
with hysterical amnesias’).<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>This work contains a chapter entitled <em>“New Contributions
to the Theory of Homosexuality.”</em> Here
<em>Sadger</em> abandons entirely his former notion about
the significance of the fourth year and states:
“<em>Permanent</em> inclination towards one’s own sex
usually comes to surface and is certainly increased
during puberty, or during the prepubescent period
at the earliest, in our latitude around the tenth or
eleventh year. Occasionally an earlier onset is recorded
and every case of that kind is due to some
special factors.” Permanent homosexuality is established
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>through some significant incident which
leads to the repression of the mother in her rôle as
helper and teacher. Such incidents are death,
sudden financial reverse, and consequent serious
neurosis, making sanatorium treatment necessary,
inconsiderate persecution of the boy on account of
masturbation and similar traumata. The love feeling
is turned from the mother to the father, or to
older comrades, or to comrades of about the same
age, who stand as substitutes for the mother and
initiate the boy into the facts of love....</p>

<p class='c004'>The path to homosexuality leads over love of
self, through narcissism. “The state of being in love
with one’s own person, which shows itself also in the
admiration of one’s own genitalia (<em>sic</em>), is never
absent as a developmental phase.” Every person
has two aboriginal sexual objectives to which he
clings throughout life: the mother and self. The
father replaces self only for a short period because
as the primary rival in his relationship to
the mother the child early assumes an antagonistic
attitude towards him. The <em>urning</em> hates woman for
an obvious reason: “when the best of women, my
own mother, amounts to no more than that, what
can there be to any other woman?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Here follows a convincing proof that the <em>urning</em>
identifies himself with his mother. The <em>urning</em> always
plans to instruct his beloved, for the mother
does it. (Does not the father, rather, do it?) The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>patient has instructed a waiter in geology and history
of art, subjects which did not interest the
latter. But the mother had done the same....</p>

<p class='c004'>Most <em>urnings</em> are said to be “only” children.
(This statement like many another of <em>Sadger’s</em>, is
positively false. Among 500 homosexuals <em>Hirschfeld</em>
found only 67 “only” children and among them
only 54 were sons. My own statistical figures are
even smaller. But the percentage among my neurotics
is practically the same.)</p>

<p class='c004'><em>Sadger</em> summarizes his findings in five fundamental
statements:</p>

<p class='c003'>“1. The <em>urning</em> is a victim of withdrawal from
the mother (the first caretaker or nurse, respectively)
in whom he is himself seriously disappointed.
He represses the mother by identifying himself completely
with her.</p>

<p class='c004'>2. The path to homosexuality leads through narcissism,
that is, love of self, as one was, or as one
may ideally be.</p>

<p class='c004'>3. The sexual ideal of the invert includes not
only traits of former female and male sexual objectives
but also features of one’s own beloved self.</p>

<p class='c004'>4. Being brought up in surroundings exclusively
feminine—the father does not count in such circumstances—fosters
homosexuality in the male as
well as in the female, for reasons that are not sufficiently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>clear as yet. Moreover the <em>urning</em> is
usually an only child.</p>

<p class='c004'>5. Finally inversion may be fostered by a sort
of ‘latter-day obedience’ to the mother’s commands.
I have observed not rarely that mothers warn their
children against harmless, though warm and friendly
contact with the other sex, as something unpermissible
and bad and that the teaching thus instilled
may unfortunately increase the disposition to one’s
own sex through later obedience.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The first of these conclusions is a false one. The
homosexual is not a victim of withdrawal from the
mother, but rather of a fixation on her. But this
subject will be discussed fully later.</p>

<p class='c004'>One represses no person with whom one identifies
one’s self. <em>Identification is direct love, differentiation
means repression.</em> Many homosexuals identify
themselves with the mother—of that there can be
no doubt. But that identification already implies
the repression of the father-ideal. <em>The problem of
homosexuality cannot be solved one-sidedly, and I
have the records of a number of cases in which the
mother plays no rôle whatever.</em></p>

<p class='c004'>The only psychologic hypothesis we possess—<em>Sadger’s</em>—fails
to satisfy on account of its onesidedness.
It holds true of certain cases. But it
neglects entirely the great significance of sadism,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>it overlooks the fact that the attachment to the
father is more important and more deeply repressed
than the love for the mother, it overlooks entirely
the identification with the father and the differentiation
from him and it fails altogether to explain the
occurrence of later homosexuality, which is of particular
interest to us (<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">tardive Homosexualität</span></i>).
The awakening of homosexuality is ascribed to a
period which varies according to the different investigators
all the way from the fifth to the twentieth
year, and even later. I mention here the ages
shown in the first twenty of my cases taken at random.
Homosexuality became manifest at 12, 10, 12,
15, 16, 22, 13, 11, 14, 8, 14, 12, 17, 17, 17, 13, 21,
15, 17, 24 (Average, 15).</p>

<p class='c004'>The ages as given are generally high,—only in
one subject did the homosexual attitude become
manifest as early as the eighth year. But that,
certainly, is incorrect. For we know that the homosexual
leaning is present already during the earliest
period and positively that children’s feeling-attitude
is bisexual during the first few years. The figures
are significant only as showing us that “genuine
homosexuality” is preceded by a lengthy period of
latency.</p>

<p class='c003'>I begin this chapter with the history of a case,
a subject with whom I have never spoken. I know
him only through correspondence. Nevertheless the
case seems to me of great significance as it substantiates
many of my previous conclusions. The need
of psychologic insight as shown by our necessarily
brief histories of homosexuals becomes more fully
obvious as we become acquainted with a complete
analysis of a homosexual.</p>

<p class='c003'>62. Mr. G. L. writes me:</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“I shall attempt to conform with your request
and give you a cursive and true insight into my
sexual and mental life. Born and raised the youngest
of ten children, three of whom died early of
children’s diseases, I lived in the country till my
5th year, when I started going to school and I remember
nothing of that period except that I
was tremendously fond of <em>playing with fire</em> and
that I kept up till then, more or less, the habit of
bed-wetting, an act which was associated with the
pleasurable feeling that I was sitting on the chamber.
I know also that I envied my sisters a great
deal. My unusually strict and religious parents
naturally subjected me to rigorous training and thus
I learned early to distinguish between mine and
thine, good and evil, truth and falsehood. Continually
watched over by parents and instructors—a
custom contrary to the modern spirit—I was kept
from many of the children’s games.</p>

<p class='c004'>“When I did play, it was mostly with boys and I
do not recall having preferred the company of girls.
My free time was taken up a great deal with agricultural
pursuits and I was about 8 years of age
when the first sexual episode took place which left
an impression on my mind, <em>having witnessed that
year how some boys of my own age played with the
sexual parts of a dog and, another time, how the
same boys played with their own sexual parts, taking
one another’s member in the mouth,—but without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>feeling on my part any desire to imitate them.
With girls I came but little into contact as a child,
but I remember once having been present when several
boys, 11–12 years of age, abused a girl</em> but I
took no part in the deed. At about that period I
put on women’s clothes a few times though today a
man in women’s clothes rather disgusts me. Two
incidents concerning me personally are still vivid
in my memory, namely, playing once with my privates,
in the presence of other boys, and another
time, warmly embracing the naked body of another
boy while playing a ‘mother and father’ game.
Thirteen years thus passed with nothing eventful
taking place, except a fall from a tree as the result
of which I hurt myself rather seriously. It was at
that period that my teacher, who considered me not
only a bright boy but a model student as well, prevailed
upon my struggling parents to permit me
to continue my schooling. I was able to secure, in
fact, a free scholarship at an Institute. Shortly
after that a schoolmate grew attached to me and he
<em>taught me to masturbate</em>. Although I had already
erections, there was no seminal loss, probably on
account of deficient development. He and another
schoolmate prevailed on me to masturbate then—but
nothing more. About that time other comrades
were in the habit of speaking of some girl or other,
admiring her beauty. <em>This talk about a ‘pretty
girl’ struck me as strange</em>, so far as I remember.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>It was during my second high school year (<i><span lang="da" xml:lang="da">gymnasial-klasse</span></i>),—I
may have been just over my 14th
year, at the time,—when a teacher appeared in class
with the trousers absent-mindedly unbuttoned and
when I noticed it my eyes became glued on his
trouser fly as though in a trance, and thus I awoke,
for the first time, to the sad realization of my sexual
bend. From that time on I noticed that I was extraordinarily
attracted to this teacher although he
did not like me in school. It was then that my first
struggles, the first wishes in my awakened boyish
soul, began to shape themselves. There were two
boys in particular who, among others, charmed me
with their attractiveness. I masturbated a great
deal during that period, without indulging in any
particular phantasies,—occasionally in the company
of other boys. But I had the feeling of being sexually
attracted to boys and in my dreams appeared
the wish to be their friend. But the stimuli were
not of a character which I found impossible to curb.
Next I felt myself irresistibly attracted to an elderly
man. Neither in the waking state nor in my
dreams did I think at all of women during that time.
Around my 18th year I experienced the first stormy
upheaval which nearly unbalanced me. I came into
close touch with a distant relative, an attractive,
interesting and splendid intellectual man who, moreover,
was happily married. I then passed through
the anguish of unrequited love, kept dreaming of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>what was beyond my reach, and endeavored to still
my unnatural passion through excessive onanism.
The keen struggle to preserve my secret, the intense
mental torture, caused me one day to break down.
The strict but kind-hearted talk of my relative in
whom, of necessity, I forced myself to confide, saved
me that time from suicide. The next day the house
physician was called, a cordial and kindly young
man, who took a strong professional interest in me.
Day after day he spoke to me and tried to influence
my mind and he succeeded in shifting my sexual feelings
entirely into the background and in about five
months he thought I was ready to try regular intercourse.
But the attempt proved a new defeat
for me. <em>The secret aversion, the fear of infection</em>,
made me prove myself impotent at the critical moment.
But I did not tell the physician <em>and shortly
thereafter he dismissed me as cured</em>. There followed
again years of struggle. Fearing mental breakdown
I was driven to the idea of seeking final release
through suicide. But I lacked courage for
the deed.... Was it cowardice, was it the yearning
of my sickly body that prevented me from ending
then a life unblessed by a single experience of
that highest yearning of a healthy body,—the consummation
of love? During that time my relative
also died and my anguish was unbearable. For I
was absorbed in that great passion of mine so deeply
that I had forgotten all about the rest of the world.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>I was hardly reconciled to that misfortune when
further anguish came into my life; several men
crossed my path with whom I would have no doubt
entered into intimacy if I had found any points of
contact. In my despairing mood I confided in
<em>Hofrat W.</em>, who consoled me saying that my misfortune
could not be very deep rooted since I had
come to him about it. He advised me to seek intimacy
with girls (I came a great deal in contact
with girls in the course of my daily work and also
forced myself to learn dancing). In accordance
with his advice I resorted to <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">puellæ publicæ</span></i> and
had intercourse a number of times but without particular
pleasure or satisfaction. Yes, I went so far
as to propose marriage to a girl of a good family.
It was my fate not to meet with a favorable response,
although secretly I was gratified at that.
For I could not think that my supreme passion intimately
and indissolubly linked to the nature, the
appearance and form of boyhood and charming old
age would ever be overcome. Springtide and autumn,
boyhood and old age, evoke in me the wonders
of development and suggest the soft quiet stealing
in of blissful eternal peace. Although the sense of
touch alone is enough to rouse in me the most wonderful
feeling of bliss, contact with a woman leaves
me indifferent, if it does not actually inspire me
with disgust. Thus I kept up for a time longer,
greatly agitated but unyielding, the fear of being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>discovered keeping me back. Tortured at night by
the yearnings of the day while dreaming of endless
bliss by conjuring up the most intimate scenes depicting
contact, dreaming and thinking also of oral
(lip) contact, but never of any love act <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a posteriori</span></i>.
In terror of being found out—I blushed at the
lightest pointed joke when in company—I often
thought of joining the foreign legion or to migrate
to some country where homosexual love is not looked
upon as a crime or as something shameful.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Often I heard of places where persons of my
bent may be found but I never had the courage to
look them up, fearing that I would be recognized,
that I would be put to shame and that I should lose
my means of subsistence. I am particularly pained
at the thought that I must pass for an inferior
dissolute type while millions and millions of insignificant
tramps are placed on a higher level in the
eyes of the law, enjoy life and are even honored
and respected while I, in spite of possessing the
qualities of a truer manhood, must waste my life
in joyless existence. Two women came into my life
with whom I became somewhat intimate, <em>one attracting
me temporarily because her physical appearance
was like that of a boy underdeveloped, the other,
because I was at the time under the influence of
alcohol</em>. But I noticed in connection with those two
experiences that I felt no particular satisfaction
during bodily contact with the women or while kissing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>them, <em>in fact, many women cause me nausea if
I so much as take food out of their hand</em>. Several
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">puellæ publicæ</span></i> have tried to rouse my sexual feelings
(<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lambentes glandem membri</span></i>), but in spite of
erection I felt no particular pleasure, and the act
was always followed by a feeling of despair—the
same old story. Sometimes in my anguish I sought
the church and there I broke into tears and I yearningly
clasped my hands in prayer without being a
believer at heart. Ofttimes I thought my mind must
be affected and thought I had to go to an asylum
for the insane but it would make my trouble known
to do so and I feared I should have to forego contact
with men forever after that. Occasionally <em>I
dreamed also of women</em>, but without any particular
feelings, while if I dreamed of clasping in a warm
embrace or only touching or even merely looking at
a boy, or at an elderly man, I felt great pleasure.
I dreamed of contact with the lips. Something more
about the family: On account of father’s strict discipline
<em>I inclined more to mother who was more indulgent</em>.
One of four sisters is married, also both
brothers, happy and satisfied, I believe. (I am very
bashful with all my relations, old and young.) One
uncle only showed eccentricities and he remained
single. All my other habits of life are not unlike
those of any normal young man, I have friends who
are married and who are unaware of my condition.
But time after time I am tremendously agitated on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>account of my mental struggle. Finally, to conclude:
my dear doctor, you cannot prevail upon me
again to try to look you up at your office because
the penetrating look of your office girl inspires me
with the fear that my condition is recognized and
diagnosed at a glance. If you feel inclined to advise
me how best to withstand this craving or to
mention some country where I may go, I should be
very grateful to you—if not, I have learned to bear
defeat.”...</p>

<p class='c003'>One of the usual confessions, overlooking most
important features. The self-incriminating feeling
of the masochist who has “learned to bear defeat,”
is indicated by the ridiculous fear of the “penetrating
look” of my office girl. This fear would probably
be traced through analysis to his sadistic attitude
towards women. There are a number of other
interesting statements. He belongs to a family of
many children, a severe father, a negligent mother,
he is jealously envious of his sisters. A large number
of homosexual episodes are related about his
childhood and his habit of putting on women’s
clothes. That shows clearly the tendency to identify
himself with the mother or sister. But why
did he want to be a woman? Why did he want to
assume the rôle of mother? He wanted to supply
a woman, to substitute the mother to his father.
Here it was <em>the strong father</em> who so attracted the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>boy that the latter wanted to be everything to him;
Subsequently he falls in love repeatedly with elderly
men who stand for substitutes of his father. The
elderly man is always the <em>Imago</em> of the father.
During the homosexual episodes with elderly men,
either actual or occurring merely in the boy’s fancy,
he finds himself still a child towards whom the father
displays tenderness and who is permitted by the
father to carry on <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fellatio</span></i> upon the latter. He is
also drawn to young boys. There he plays the rôle
of the father while the boy supplies the picture of
his own youth.</p>

<p class='c004'>Interesting is his distinct disgust at women which
disappears after alcoholic drinks enough so as to
enable him to carry out coitus. He was also near
falling in love with a girl who had a boyish appearance.
That betrays certain relations between boy
and girl. The boys are loved when they show the
traits of a beloved sister, the old men when they
recall the father.</p>

<p class='c004'>His path towards woman is blocked. Disgust and
fear of infections cover more significant motives
bearing a religious coloring. Every prostitute becomes
the sister, a younger edition of the mother.
Without analysis the genesis of this paraphilia cannot
be understood. He avoids me because he is
unwilling to discover the truth. The over-severe
father seems to have roused in him the yearning for
a kindlier one and to have determined the development
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>of his feeling-attitude. An attachment to the
sister seems also clearly discernible.</p>

<p class='c003'>63. Mr. T. D., 26 years of age, has struggled
vainly for years against his homosexual disposition.
He is attracted to old, gray-bearded men, who
always represent to his mind an erotic ideal, and
loves to be in their company, go on walks with them,
play cards or perform music, and loves also the
company of very simple fellows, preferably sailormen,
plasterers, and soldiers, and among the latter
prefers artillerists. His sexual activity consists in
holding the friend’s <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">membrum virile</span></i> in his hand and
giving his own to be held by the other likewise.
Orgasm follows rapidly at that. After the deed,
regrets and strong avowals never to repeat it. The
last time he tried it a watchman caught him in the
act and brought him together with his companion,
a workingman, to court.</p>

<p class='c004'>Analysis discloses the following facts: He has
repeatedly tried to have intercourse with women but
each time great fear and disgust prevented. Strong
erections, but before <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">immissio penis</span></i>, the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">membrum</span></i>
turns soft and useless. Accomplishment of the orgasm
through manual friction of the organ by the
woman’s hand is possible, but is followed by a powerful
feeling-attitude of disgust and he must leave
immediately. He has had various opportunities to
become intimate with certain women and girls, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>have even incited him to it, but he does not feel
tempted.</p>

<p class='c004'>His family history is as follows: He is the only
son of a very kindly man who died four years previously.
The mother died at his birth and that has
established in his mind an intimate association between
coitus and death. He cannot help thinking
of that association when with women. His father
was extraordinarily tender with him, and for his
sake never married again. When he was still young
his father always played with him, devoting to him
all his spare time. Later their relationship became
even more intimate. There was a sort of marriage
situation with his father.</p>

<p class='c004'>He began to masturbate at a very early age and
claims to have indulged in phantasies only about
common men, imagining they were handling his
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">membrum virile</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>His attachment to his father was decidedly morbid.
If the father stayed away from the house a
quarter of an hour longer than usual, he began to
cry and could not be consoled. The whole object of
his life was to bring joy to his father and to replace
in the latter’s life the lost mother. When the father
fell ill he took it so much to heart that it was feared
his mind would break down. After the death of his
father he attempted suicide and was thwarted in
the act by his father’s faithful servant. He made
all sorts of resolutions, among others, not to masturbate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>during the year of mourning. He did not
live up to that.... At first he is unable to recall
heterosexual episodes from his childhood and his
memory fails him equally regarding homosexual
facts. But suddenly the cloud which seemed to cover
his childhood lifts and a vast number of reminiscences
come to surface, showing the developmental
course of his homosexual tendency. His father had
always been a strong admirer of the other sex and
even as a child he had observed that the father was
maintaining intimate relations with the nurse, the
cook, as well as with the maid servant. Once he
surprised his father in the act of embracing the
cook while the two were alone in the room. The
irate father boxed his ear because he entered without
knocking at the door. That was one of the
rare occasions on which his father punished him.
He also overheard at night how his father crawled
into the nurse’s bed, who was still very young and
pretty at the time and carried on all sorts of doings
with her. Later he received private instruction from
a male tutor who conformed to the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">genius loci</span></i> and
was also intimate with the servant girl. As a child
he often wished he were a woman so as to take the
cook’s place in gratifying his father. The father
seemed to fear that the boy might fall into the
women’s hands and did not delay warning his son
with appropriate teachings. At 12 years of age his
father instructed him frankly about the dangers of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>masturbation, with the result that he struggled hard
against the habit without, however, overcoming it.
A few years later his father spoke to him about the
terrible dangers of venereal diseases, warning him
against prostitutes. He was told he must watch
out, for he would have frequently occasion to go
through the city, and the prostitutes are always
eager to seduce such innocent young boys so that
many a one is ruined for life.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is significant also that at 5 years of age he
played with a girl from the neighborhood, trying to
imitate the father. He must have hurt the girl for
she cried out, the nurse rushed in, a serious scene
ensued, and he was severely chastised by the nurse.</p>

<p class='c004'>An ugly impression was produced on him when
he witnessed a terrible quarrel between their cook
and the nurse who were jealous of each other on
account of the father’s attentions. They grabbed
each other by the hair and the whole household was
in an uproar. The cook had to leave the house at
once. He believes that after that incident his father
gave up all intimate relations with the women in the
house. At 19 years of age he fell in love with the
cashier of a coffee house and would have very much
liked to possess her. But his father, to whom he
told everything, warned him against all cashier
women because they are usually diseased and infected.
As a warning he told him that in his youth
he once suffered very unpleasant consequences as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>result of an affair with that kind of a woman and
was even subjected to blackmail.</p>

<p class='c004'>He filled his heart with a gruesome fear of woman.
In addition to that he placed in his hands a
book relating all about the evil consequences of
sexual diseases, so that after that he did not dare
come near a woman without the protection of a
condom. After intercourse, which consisted merely
of digital manipulations in his case, he had to
bathe at once and to wash his genitals with soap
several times. After homosexual acts he did not
feel the compulsion to carry out these ablutions.</p>

<p class='c004'>We now come to the analysis of his acts, which
show themselves veritable compulsive manifestations.
Suddenly he becomes restless, energetically tries to
control himself, then paces back and forth for
hours, until he falls into the hands of one of the
male prostitutes who easily recognize their prospective
victims. But as he never mentioned any name
and never established any lasting intimate relations,
he escaped blackmail. Once he thought that a certain
masseur had studied his physiognomy and had
later recognized him. He saw that fellow a few
times in front of his home. Immediately he left
Vienna and undertook an extensive journey which
kept him for some months in foreign countries.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the act he tried to find the love caresses of his
father. He split love into its well recognized two
components. The erotic side he reserved for elderly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>men, physicians, and the faithful elderly friends,—while
for sexuality proper he turned exclusively towards
men of low rank. Similarly he divided his
father’s personality into two parts, the high-striving,
intellectual, lofty-minded father, and the
woman fancier, the lover of ordinary servant girls.
He was still playing the rôle of a male but during
the act he regressed back to childhood, becoming
again a child who longs for the father’s tender love
squandered on servant girls. Moreover the ordinary
males also had the traits of servants, they
were of the servant class.</p>

<p class='c004'>We have here an instance of the transposition of
the love of servant girls to males. He had always
a weakness for servant girls and since he feared he
might yet get tangled up in marriage with a cook, he
tried to keep away from them. Only once in the
home of a friend he embraced suddenly a cook and
passionately kissed her. “I could have without a
doubt cohabited with her,” he told me. But he soon
quit visiting that particular friend....</p>

<p class='c004'>He identified himself completely with the father.
He lived in his own house, acted like the father, had
the same kind of wardrobe, although his father had
aged a great deal. But in one respect he wanted
to be different. He engaged therefore a male servant
and always took his meals outside, so as to have
no cook in the house. But that servant he kept
always at a certain distance. He did not care to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>have any love affairs with servants in the house, like
his father.</p>

<p class='c004'>The analysis disclosed his repressed sadistic attitude
towards woman. His first attempts at intercourse
with women failed him and he was able
to carry out coitus successfully only under the influence
of alcohol. Later he did recall a single
successful coitus without that aid. The girl had
roused his anger with the remark that he was merely
an insolent fellow. He jumped at her, ready to
strike her, and was tremendously excited. In that
roused state he carried out coitus. <em>But he would
have rather strangled her.</em></p>

<p class='c004'>He showed an idiosyncrasy against certain female
occupations. Nurses in their garb he would have
gladly torn to pieces. He also hated all nuns. It
was not well for any woman to rouse his anger.
He could be very dangerous when roused. He confesses
entertaining as his favorite phantasy the
thought of tearing to pieces a woman.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reason for this sadistic attitude: His <em>infantile
jealousy</em> of all women since woman had robbed
him of his father’s love. Among them was also a
nurse who had taken care of the father during a
prolonged illness.</p>

<p class='c004'>That hatred of women made him impotent and
drove him into the homosexual path. For he was
afraid of himself when finding himself alone in the
presence of a woman. He rushed away from houses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>of prostitution suddenly, as if a thousand demons
were after him.</p>

<p class='c004'>I succeeded in convincing him that this sadistic
attitude was a rudiment of his early feelings, that
he was really fighting against ghosts which he had
long since dispelled. Now it was up to him to avow
consciously his criminal tendencies and to render
them innocuous through meeting them in the open.
Presently he began having intercourse with <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">puellæ
publicæ</span></i>, before the analysis was ended, and even
undertook to carry out coitus <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lege artis</span></i>. He forced
himself to do it because he no longer cared to incur
the risk of coming into conflict with the law. (The
legal case against him was squashed because there
had been committed no overt act and such manipulations
ordinarily are unpunished in Austria, if they
cause no open scandal.) Later he chose a sweetheart
who accompanied him on his travels and whom
he suddenly abandoned. He had meanwhile met a
woman who captivated him mentally and spiritually.
Two years later I received their engagement card.
In this case the analysis accomplished a complete
recovery.</p>

<p class='c003'>Here we found a complete fixation on the father,
which had to be overcome first in order to free the
path to woman which had become obstructed by all
sorts of infantile imperatives. Neither the mother
nor the persons who trained him during his earlier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>years play any rôle in the psychogenesis of his
homosexuality; on the other hand there was his
strong sadistic attitude towards women which
showed itself in a personally baffling fear of women.</p>

<p class='c004'>This case shows how one-sided <em>Sadger’s</em> explanation
is of homosexuality, when he traces its psychogenesis
solely to the relations with the mother and
overlooks entirely the rôle of the father.</p>

<p class='c004'>We must also bear in mind that many children
gravitate to the mother only because they feel themselves
neglected by the father, because they hate the
father, and are unable to attain a proper feeling-attitude
towards him. Precisely that overstressed
love of the mother and the obvious antagonism
against the father adroitly covers the fixation on
the father.</p>

<p class='c004'>I will now report three similar cases from my own
practice, relating only the important details:</p>

<p class='c003'>64. Mr. S. L. has not worked as bank employee
for the past three years or more. Three years ago
he began to complain of various nervous ailments
and was granted a leave of absence to recover his
health. That leave proved his undoing. He did not
improve; instead, he became totally unable to work
and is now no longer able to return to his duties.
His father always maintained that the whole trouble
was imaginary, and wanted to hear nothing of a
prolongation of the leave. But the man’s suffering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>became gradually worse. Out of spite for his
father’s attitude he at first simulated the aggravation
of his trouble and his condition in the end
actually grew so much worse that it shattered him
to pieces and he lost control over himself. He
experienced attacks of dyspnea so severe that he
could not talk. The dyspnea occurred in paroxysms.
After one year he lost his position with
the bank and, reduced to want, he appealed to his
well-to-do father for aid. The father denied him
any assistance because he did not consider the son
unable to work; he thought the son was simulating
so as to impose on him. S. L. sued his father for
sustenance and won, aided by the testimony of a
number of physicians who certified that his case was
one of severe neurasthenia, so that his father had to
give him a monthly allowance. Father and son
broke all personal relations so that the payment was
made through an attorney. Thereafter S. L. was
inspired by no other thought than revenge on his
father. He was very clever in thinking out new
legal issues and additional suits against him. Finally
he came to the conclusion he was not the rightful
son of his father and threatened a law suit which
only his love for his mother prevented him from
actually starting. She was revolted at the son’s
terrible accusation but so strongly under his influence
that she did not have the will power to break
with him. She met him clandestinely, placing money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>into his hands. He loved his mother above all else
and urged her to leave the father. He put detectives
on his father’s trail, hoping to be able to fasten
against him the accusation of being untrue to the
mother. He always spoke of his father as “the old
rascal,” “the old scamp,” “that miserable, quarrelsome
rake.” “Should I see him today writhe in
agony it would be the best and most pleasant day
I ever had.” I had never seen before so bitter a
hatred of the father.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was a confirmed homosexual, hating all women
with the exception of his mother, whom he held in
divine veneration. The alleged breach of faithfulness
which he alleged her to have committed with a
person of high position (the well-known family
romance of the neurotic) he excused as natural for
it would have been a miracle for that noble soul to
have remained true to so terrible a man. The father
compelled her to coitus with brute force. He was
the offspring of such a coercion, etc.... He loved
only younger men, even boys, and he was fairly
brutal towards them. Occasionally he carried on
deeds with older men towards whom he then preserved
an attitude of submissiveness and passivity,
trying to please them in every way. He permitted
pederasty on his person and did not shrink from
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fellatio</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The analysis showed a passionate love of the
father, a feeling which on account of its unattainable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>aspect turned into bitter hatred. He thought the
father was partial to the other sons and fled to the
mother to whom he often complained about the
father’s severity and lack of affection. In his homosexual
acts he played actively the rôle of the father,
becoming at such times very severe and almost cruel,
passively he carried out the act as if he were with
the father, being then very submissive, and thus
allowing his whole repressed love to outflow as if
bent on showing him: <em>that is how loving I would be
with you always if you only were agreeable!</em> Cruel
phantasies revolving around revenge upon the father
as the central theme were confessed under strong
resistances. Several times he came near shooting
his father. He often fancied himself in situations in
which his father depended altogether on his compassion
and magnanimity. For instance, he would
imagine his father had committed some great fraud.
He himself had become a millionaire through an
ingenious invention of his own. His father comes
begging at his feet and is refused any aid. His
favorite reading is books describing cruel punishments,
the inquisition tortures, etc. The well-known
work of <em>Octave Mirbeau</em>, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le jardin des supplices</span></i>,”
threw him into ecstasy.</p>

<p class='c004'>The other roots of this subject’s homosexuality
I do not dwell upon because I am concerned here
only with the rôle of the father....</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>The next case shows a very similar situation:</p>

<p class='c003'>65. Mr. G. Z. for some years has had intimate
relations with an elderly man, an artist, whose
studio is the meeting place of a number of young
men exclusively. He is not a musician like the
others, but a jurist, and had met incidentally Mr. X,
his fatherly friend, as he calls the man. Before that
time he had been entirely abstinent. He became
Mr. X’s friend only at the age of 21. The friendship
was wholly platonic until they undertook a
journey together. At Salzburg they occupied together
the same room, because the hotel was filled.
They carried on intercourse (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">coitus inter femora</span></i>),
he playing the female rôle on that occasion as well
as subsequently. G. Z.’s relations with his father
are very stressed. They hardly speak to each other.
He is employed in his father’s office, but has only
business relations with him. His whole spare time
he devotes to his mother. One day he surprised his
mother with the information that he had had his
father watched and found out that the father maintained
clandestine relations with a number of women.
He requested his mother to break with the father.
He raised a terrible row with his father, ordering
the father to withdraw from the office and leave the
business entirely to him, and at that the father
showed him the door. A letter from the mother
convinces him that he is not the son of his father;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>thereupon he locks himself in the room and commits
suicide by shooting himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jealousy of the father had driven him to suicide.
During the acts with the fatherly friend he played
the rôle of the son replacing the women in the life
of the father.</p>

<p class='c003'>66. Mr. T. B., 32 years of age, like Case 64, is
also unable to work. He has tried everything but
cannot make anything go. His father is a common
employee reduced to seek occasionally the son’s
financial aid. But the young man now stays at
home and complains of attacks which he describes
as of an epileptic nature, occurring only at night,
but which prove to be hysterical anxiety attacks.
His brother is diligent and hard-working, the
favorite of the family. When the brother is praised
he turns so wild that he is boiling with rage. He
speaks but little with the brother, exchanging with
him only necessary words. Regarding his father he
declares that living together with him he finds most
painful. He has delicate tastes. But his father’s
manner of eating and talking rouses his anger. He
will bless the day when he shall once more be working
and in a position to leave the parental home. The
mother was on his side, believed in his illness and in
the genuineness of his attacks, and comes at night
during his attacks to his bed, trying to help him
and to quiet him to the best of her powers. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>mother alone knows that he is homosexual and she
does not disturb him in the least on that score.
But she turns jealous as soon as she sees him pay
any attention to a girl, and every night, too, she
comes to the kitchen to make sure that her sons are
not taking advantage of the servant girls. She
accompanies the ailing son on his errands and is his
confidante. She does not get along at all well with
her husband and they have ceased marital relations
long ago. There are thus two parties in the house,
he with his mother, and the father with the other son.</p>

<p class='c004'>Moreover, the ailing son raises various issues so
that there are daily quarrels and conflicts in the
house. The father published a statement in the
newspaper to the effect that he will no longer be
responsible for debts and obligations contracted by
the son. Thereupon the mother, who earns an independent
income with her piano lessons, left the house
together with her favorite son. They rented another
home for themselves and the mother hopes that the
separation and the quiet care will bring about her
son’s complete recovery. At this stage T. B. is
brought to me for analysis. Two days later I am
called to the father. T. B. had gone there under an
excuse and while searching among the books he was
seized with a very severe attack and had to be put
to bed. He was now so ill that he could not leave
the bed. It was the love of the father that had
driven him to the place. He could not live without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>seeing his father and could not endure the thought
of leaving the father alone with the brother. The
mother moved back to the old home. As prerequisites
for my analysis I suggested isolation of the
subject and moderate occupation, and the mother
apparently agreed. Next day the patient wrote me
that on account of his attacks he would be unable to
live among strangers, and that therefore he must
give up the treatment. An experience similar to
that I had with the epileptic, Case No. 51.</p>

<p class='c004'>The specific phantasy during his indulgences in
which he played always a passive rôle, represented
him as the mother who gives herself up to the father.
The following dream yielded some light on the
matter:</p>

<p class='c003'>“<em>I lie on the bed in a remarkable attire, a hood on
my head and dressed in a green robe. I gaze in a
looking-glass and instead of my person I see my
mother, and father in the act of bending over her
to give her a kiss. Now the image in the looking-glass
fuses with the original, the two coming together
and forming a single picture. I feel myself
turning into a woman and everything male about me
falls off or disappears. I have long black hair, a
white skin and a high voice. My arms stretch out
to embrace a man and I awake with a feeling of
anxiety and a rapid heart beat.</em>”</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>An analysis of this dream is superfluous. The
subject was unwilling to see its meaning.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the fixation upon the mother is often also
marked with hatred. It must not be thought
that the homosexual is always disposed pleasantly
towards the mother. It also happens that the love
for the mother is covered under an overt hatred and
an unnatural disgust, as is shown by the following
case:</p>

<p class='c003'>67. H. U., 24-year-old sculptor, homosexual as
long as he can remember. His inclination is always
towards waiters and restaurant employees. Has
four sisters and an older brother who had to go to
America and is lost to them. His father is a writer,
a genial but impractical man who stuck to journalism.
He clings to his father with every fiber of
his heart, protecting him against the attacks of the
mother who is tired of her husband’s continual love
affairs and cannot stand them any longer. The
father lives in a dreamy state continuously, passing
from one ecstasy, lasting from several days to a
week, into another. He is not finicky in his love
adventures, drawing the line neither at servant girls
nor at prostitutes; daily he has some new rendezvous
and in that way squanders a great portion of his
income. There are always quarrels in the house,
and the father does not like to stay at home, preferring
to spend his evenings in the public houses.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>The relations between mother and son are as unpleasant
as between the parents. The son always
lets his mother know that she is repulsive to him.
If she attempts to come near him in the room he
avoids her, shouting: “<em>Don’t touch me, mir graust
vor dir,—you give me the shivers!</em>” He never permits
her to fondle him, and has no good word for
the poor tortured woman. Towards his sister he is
also always sarcastic, aloof, and likes to meet her
admirers to make uncomplimentary remarks about
her to them. The situation became seriously aggravated,
he had to leave the house, and now wants to
meet no one of the family except the father, whom
he sees daily at the newspaper office. He hates
fanatically all women and dotes on <em>Strindberg</em> and
<em>Weininger</em>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Back of this hatred of women stands his great
love for the mother, the sisters, and all women. In
that respect he is exactly like his father, whose fate
he does not want to share. He protects himself
against the love for his mother because he would be
lost and subordinate to women if he yielded. The
gruesome quarrels which he witnessed during his
childhood showed him a father who ruined himself
on account of women, a man unable to achieve the
full expression of his high ideal because he squandered
his energies on numerous love adventures.
Homosexuality serves him as a protection against
all womanhood. His attachment to waiters is explained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>through the fact that his mother had been
a waitress whom his father had married after she
had become pregnant by him so as to legitimatize
the child. After two weeks he breaks up the analysis
because he feels that his attitude towards women is
being changed. In that attitude lies his security.
Among waiters he prefers small young boys who
remind him of his sister.</p>

<p class='c003'>This fixation upon the sister is not so rare, as is
shown by the next case, which dates back to my
earlier psychoanalytic experience.</p>

<p class='c003'>68. Mr. P. G., teacher in a high school (<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Realschule
professor</span></i>), consults me on account of an
ailment which began a few weeks ago and which
threatens to destroy all his joy of living. He is 26
years of age and has had no sexual intercourse.
In fact, he has not had even one genuine love affair.
A few months ago he met a girl whom he liked very
much and they became engaged. They were to be
married in six months. She is a friend of his sister’s,
a girl to whom he had not previously paid any particular
attention but during an outing he got to
know her and to appreciate her so well that he fell
suddenly in love with her. It was not a great consuming
passion,—rather a mutual understanding
and a strong spiritual kinship. He was abstinent
through conviction. He wanted to enter the marriage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>bond a pure man and was proud that in that
respect he was unlike his friends and colleagues.
Then something happened in his life which threatened
to break him to pieces and even drove him to
thoughts of suicide. I relate the occurrence in his
own words:</p>

<p class='c004'>“In my class there is a very beautiful, physically
imposing, slim, bright young fellow whom I liked on
account of his excellent answers and fine manners.
I directed my questions at him with great pleasure,
whenever the other boys could not answer, knowing
that I would always receive from him the correct
answer, and I have often held this favorite scholar
of mine up to the others as an example of how they
ought to be. One night I dreamed that the boy was
lying in my bed and that I embraced and kissed him.
I woke up, scared, and presently quieted down.
‘Nonsense,’ I said to myself. ‘Anything may come
up in a dream!’ At school that day I found myself
somewhat uneasy towards that boy because I could
not help thinking about my dream. I avoided
putting any questions to him. As was frequently
his habit, the boy waited for me after school hours
and asked permission to accompany me on the way.
We had to go the same road and I was pleased to
pass the time talking with him. He entertained me.
I heard a great deal about what the pupils were
saying about the teachers and it seemed to me very
interesting. Teaching means building up souls, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>so I wanted to implant every noble and high ideal
in the soul of this child.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I granted him also that day, gladly, permission
to come along. I was strikingly distracted and
silent. Whereas formerly I had been in the habit
of taking him by the arm now and then, this time
I avoided all intimate contact, because the dream
stood between me and the handsome young boy,
rendering any intimacy or informality impossible.
I reached home and very promptly went to my bride.
She found me absent-minded, wanted to know the
reason,—and about that, naturally, I could but be
silent. I wanted to show her tenderness; she goaded
me with her kisses and caresses. But, oh, horrors!
In the midst of her kisses my mind turned to the
young fellow and when I felt her lips, so warm, I
thought it was the boy’s lips. I pushed her, scared,
out of my arms, pretending I did not feel well, and
hurried back home.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was so excited that for a long time I could not
fall asleep. I decided I would fight the insane passion.
I had heard before passingly about boy love,
knew also that it was the custom and fashion of the
day in ancient Greece, but I myself had never before
entertained the least thought of a man or boy. I
felt I ought to remain a teacher no longer if I failed
to conquer the feeling and to master the impression
of the dream picture on my mind, conjured up,
undoubtedly, by unconscious wishes. I resolved to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>be strict with myself, to give up the attachment to
the boy, and to avoid his company after school
hours. For it was I who first spoke up and invited
him to keep me company on the way home. I resolved
to be strong and to devote once more all my
affection and my love to my bride.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Next school day I forced myself not to turn my
gaze towards the boy’s seat. But I could not help
looking that way and the first glance rushed the
blood to my cheeks. He was as beautiful as a Greek
boy, his form so delicate, his eyes so smiling,—I
could have lost myself for hours in the contemplation
of that wonderful face. I roused from my day
dreaming, which, fortunately, had passed unnoticed
by the class. But I wanted to neutralize the impression
that my gazing at the boy may have made
upon the class and called upon the boy. I was
severe, unmercifully severe with him, and sought to
catch him in some error. And who fails to find an
error when looking hard for it? Then I reprimanded
the boy so severely that he began to cry and
returned to his seat weeping, and he was unable to
quiet down for some time after that. Then I became
really angry. I was trying to stifle the inner voice
which was whispering: ‘It is unfair for you to torture
thus the innocent boy; he is not responsible for
your awful thoughts....’ I disregarded that and
scolded him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“On the street the boy did not dare to offer to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>join me. I hurried past him and wandered for
hours on the streets like a madman. I reproached
myself, regretting the lost opportunity for enjoying
the boy’s company and wept over the breaking up
of the beautiful friendship between scholar and
teacher. I resolved to be fair the next day with the
boy and to pay no attention to him. But a wild
demoniac power, stronger than my good resolutions,
impelled me once more to hurt the boy’s feelings and
to humiliate him before the class. It looked as if I
was bent on revenging myself on him for the trouble
he had cost me. I knew that I punished myself
doing so, that I suffered far more than the boy,
although he, too, changed in appearance, became
timid, looked badly and obviously suffered under the
unjust treatment. I also became irritable, morose,
nervous. I lost completely my nervous equilibrium.
I began to avoid my bride’s company. It seemed
to me a profanation on my part of her pure love so
long as I was consumed with such passion for a
boy. She also became cooler and more reserved,
because she could not understand me.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Eventually things improved at school. I learned
to control myself and to act more fairly. We resumed
the walks once more; the boy accompanied me
again after school hours; sometimes we walked on
and on for hours, and we even met specially during
the holidays. In his company I felt happy and all
my wishes seemed gratified. I enjoyed his beauty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>and his lively mind and counted the minutes to pass
when we should meet again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then something happened which opened my eyes.
My bride wrote me a letter breaking up our engagement.
It did not even affect me as deeply as I had
thought it would, whenever reflecting previously on
the possibility. Very well—I thought to myself—now
you can devote yourself entirely to your beloved
boy! At the same time I felt during the day the
same physical excitation which I had theretofore
experienced only in my dreams. Then I realized
that I must avoid the boy if I was to keep from
committing a crime. My first task, I thought,
would be to make up again with the bride; secondly,
I must give up the school so as to not meet the boy
again. My bride was resolute, however, insisting
that she had become convinced that I did not love
her. I kept secrets from her. I was on the very
point of confessing everything and of telling her the
whole truth. I threw myself, weeping, to her feet.
She said quietly: ‘Don’t! What is done cannot be
undone. It is better that we should part. Don’t
make the parting hard for me. Let’s leave one
another good friends and think kindly of me.’ Then
she hurried out of the room and left me to myself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Next day when I went to the school the boy was
not there; he was ill. Another boy reported he was
kept at home on account of scarlet fever. My
anxiety about him was boundless. I could think of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>nothing but that boy. A schoolmate had to bring
me daily reports about his condition. Often I
wandered in the neighborhood of his home, up and
down the streets, and at night I watched the lamplit
window of the room where a sister was taking care
of him. Finally I heard that he was convalescing,
that all danger was over, and that he would return
to school in a few weeks. I had to keep a strong
grip on myself at school to be able to carry on my
lectures at all. My thoughts were perpetually
centered on my beloved boy pupil. Continually I
kept thinking: How many days longer must I keep
longing? In three weeks he will be here! My heart
danced with joy at the thought....</p>

<p class='c004'>“There had to be a change. I could not keep on
living that way. I took my father into confidence
and he sent me to you, thinking that you would be
able to furnish good advice and aid in this difficult
case.”</p>

<p class='c003'>I offered at first no advice and no help. To begin
with, I allowed the love-sick fellow to speak out
everything that was on his mind and that in itself
lightened his burden. Then I undertook to obtain
an insight into his mental life before the advent of
his boy love.</p>

<p class='c004'>It turned out that he had really loved and still
loves but one person in the wide world: his sister.
The affection for the bride was but a substitute for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>his love of the sister. His bride was also homosexual
and loved in him but the brother of her best
girl friend. As the girl friend (his sister) cooled
off during their engagement, preferring another
friendship (obviously led thereto by unconscious
jealousy of the brother), her own affection for the
young man cooled off and she promptly made use
of the opportunity to break off with him. The
opportunity arose conveniently enough and the
severing of the engagement reacted most painfully
upon the school teacher who had reasons of his own
for reproaching himself most bitterly.</p>

<p class='c004'><em>The more his bride kept away from his sister the
greater was his indifference to the bride. But the
boy resembled his sister very closely.</em></p>

<p class='c004'>He never thought of this similarity before. They
had the same eyes, the same color of hair, and the
same voice, and these played a strong rôle with him.
During that critical period his sister was interested
in a certain physician. He felt he was about to lose
her affection and sought a substitute for her and
that he found in his pupil....</p>

<p class='c004'>Now he was in a position to come to an understanding
with his sister. She had the requisite
psychologic insight to understand him fully and to
lend him intelligent assistance towards his recovery.</p>

<p class='c004'>His whole tremendous excitation simmered down.
The love for the boy calmed down to an attitude of
kindly interest which no longer troubled him. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>took his walks only with his sister who often called
for him at the school. Months later I heard that
he was very quiet and had no reason to complain.
He succeeded in sublimating his affection for the
sister into joint intellectual interests, insofar as
that is possible. But frank relations create a
healthy atmosphere in which it is easier to overcome
incestuous phantasies than in the byways and hidden
bypaths of repression and transference.</p>

<p class='c003'>I have given a detailed account of this case because
it is typical and because the transference of
affection from the sister to a boy is more common
than would be recognized <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</span></i> in the light of our
current contributions on homosexuality. We must
also bear in mind that the sister represents a
younger likeness of the mother <em>Imago</em>.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>But father, mother and sister do not exhaust the
ideal of the homosexual. I also know cases—one I
have described in a previous chapter—in which the
love of an older brother plays a tremendous rôle.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>We are thus led to the conclusion that fixation on
the family plays a determinative rôle in the genesis
of homosexuality, that homosexuality often may
represent a flight from incest. True, we have also
seen cases in which these roots are not traceable,
particularly cases of late homosexuality. But why
may not other psychic forces, manifesting themselves
as hatred, disgust, fear and shame, likewise lead to
homosexuality?</p>

<p class='c004'>Love of the family is a form of narcissism. Every
member of the family is a mirrored image of one’s
own personality. One may love one’s self in one’s
parents or other members of the intimate family
circle more readily than through strangers. <em>Leo
Berg</em> was the first to express this truth and he has
done it very clearly. In his inspiring work, <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geschlechter</span></cite>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>(<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kulturprobleme der Gegenwart</span></cite>, 2nd ser.,
Vol. II, Berlin, 1906), he states:</p>

<p class='c003'>“What does the homosexual substitute for procreation?
In the first place self-seeking, the love
of like (<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">die Liebe zum Gleichen</span></i>), plays a greater rôle
in his case than with the heterosexual who is responsive
to the unlike, and that is why the instinct of
procreation is as a rule very much weaker in the
former though not entirely absent. A young physician
who confessed to me that he was homosexual,
told me of a colleague who was passionately attached
to a child. It was a powerful motherly instinct in
him, a sign of his female sensitiveness in a male
body; he is wholly womanly, a submissive being, and
loves like a woman cursed only because he cannot
bear a child for the man of his heart.”</p>

<p class='c003'><em>Berg</em> also points out that the homosexuals transfer
to the intellectual sphere their reproductive and
creative urge.</p>

<p class='c004'>The case mentioned by <em>Berg</em> shows nothing in
itself more than a complete identification with the
mother. But I have observed long ago that this
love of the like bears some relations to purposive
sterility. The homosexual renounces the immortality
implied in procreation. (Many homosexual
artists achieve immortality in the realm of
spiritual endeavor.) Such an attitude discloses
a revolt against natural law and order. The homosexual,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>in fact, always conceives himself as unique.
The world contains not his equal and that feeling
is the hidden source of his pride. The “bearing of
aloofness,” already pointed out by <em>Freimark</em>,<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a> the
pride of being “different,” determine also his opposition
to the procreative instinct. He does not care
to be like others. Against the notion that God had
ordained man to have offspring he wants to oppose
all teleology and, in spite of God, maintain a purposeless,
meaningless love, contrary to nature, a
love for its own sake. Conceivably women manifest
even more clearly the corresponding revulsion
against the motherly instinct.</p>

<p class='c004'>Who will deny that fear of children, of motherhood,
is an important social manifestation? Can it
be that this fear is characteristic only of women and
is not shared also by men? May it not manifest
itself as a form of flight from sexual determinism?
We need only look around us. There are any number
of married couples who want no children and
others who want no more than a child or two.
Undoubtedly this state of things is partly due to
homosexuality, to a deviation from the biblical injunction
concerning the duty of increasing offspring.
But let us also glance over our professional experience.
The relationship between children and
their parents carries within itself the beginnings of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>a new phase. The everlasting conflict between the
new and the old generation, between fathers and
sons, mothers and daughters, children and parents,
requires, fosters new forms. Not without reason
has our age been called “the century of the child”
with its slogan raised about the Rights of Children.
The greater the (unconsciously motivated) antagonism
of the child against his parents, the stronger
will be the fear of its own children, who loom up as
potential enemies and rivals.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a> It seems that our
own image attracts and repels us at the same time,
that there is a fear of the like as strong as the fear
of the unlike. The aboriginal conflict between the
old and the new goes on forever within us. Hungry
for the new though we be, yet we cling to the old.
Having acquired the new we turn longingly to the
old.</p>

<p class='c004'>This bipolarity shows itself nowhere so distinctly
as upon the sexual sphere. It means that contraries
have the power of sexual attraction. That is an
observation substantiated by everyday experience.
But there is an extreme point at which the opposite
touches upon the like. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les extrêmes se touchent</span></i>,
extremes meet. In each of us there lives also another
who is the precise counterpart of ourselves.
In the other sex we love our counterpart and through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>the love for our own sex we endeavor to run away
from that counterpart.</p>

<p class='c004'>The mother instinct and hatred of motherhood
are not split in the human soul. The homosexual
woman always shows the hatred of motherhood and
her alleged love of children, when such a sentiment
is claimed at all, proves but a self-deception
and lip-service at best. In our study of <em>female
dyspareunia</em> we propose fully to prove that conclusion
in connection with the histories of several
homosexual women. We do find many instances of
alleged affection for children but in reality these
are only caricatures of the true sentiment and only
rarely the affection as it is characteristic of normal
woman. Our school teacher in love with the boy
pupil, whose case we gave in full in the preceding
pages, did not love children as such and did not
care to have children of his own. Through his love
for the boy the repressed father instinct also found
outlet.</p>

<p class='c004'>The life histories of homosexual women differ from
those of males only in the fact that occasionally
there seems present a certain yearning for children,
as if the child could bring about release from the
passion and a new state of bliss. Beyond that the
<em>urlind</em> shows the same psychogenesis as the <em>urning</em>.
There is a strong fixation on the family, though not
always on the father, as <em>Hirschfeld</em> claims. In addition
to that, rather commonly there is found affection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>for the mother which is fairly open, and tenderness
for some sister which persists through life and
assumes remarkable masks.</p>

<p class='c004'>I want to conclude this chapter with the histories
of some cases of female homosexuality which may
serve to illustrate clearly the points I have just
made:</p>

<p class='c003'>69. Miss Ilse—we shall call her by that name—after
a series of various exciting episodes has fallen
a victim to depression, during which she lost a great
deal of weight, but in spite of a successful fattening
régime her stay at a sanitarium did not effect a
complete cure. She is an impressively attractive
girl, 24 years of age, voluptuous, feminine in every
way up to her angular, somewhat energetic nose and
prominent, curved eyebrows. Her mother, of whom
the girl speaks with much feeling, believes that the
girl’s breakdown dates from the death of the father.
Ilse irritatedly contradicts the mother several times,
breaking into a quarrelsome attitude towards her
mother over trifles. Reprimanded by her mother,
she falls into her depression and speaks no word.
I take her under treatment and for a week I have
in her a heavy burden on my hands. She hardly
says anything, is very negativistic in her attitude,
only muttering from time to time: “Don’t trouble
yourself. It will never be any different. Better give
me something that will put me quickly out of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>way.” She livens up somewhat only when referring
to her father,—thinks he should have not passed
away. The mother should have called in a specialist.
In fact, it was as much her fault as anybody’s, for
she had failed to insist on calling the best aid while
there was time.</p>

<p class='c004'>Gradually she extends me her confidence and one
day she appears,—like a changed person. She must
tell me the truth. She is not a normal person. Since
childhood she has been homosexual and had never
cared for men. Her mother had implied as much
when she said to me: “I cannot understand the girl.
She always fled from the room when young men called
on Alfred (her brother). The girl is a man hater.”
This fact the girl had denied during the first visit,
but now she herself admitted. She had never cared
for men. On the other hand, at 11 years of age she
had already fallen passionately in love with a woman
school teacher. She was a frolicsome girl, often
wore her brother’s clothes, and played with all the
young boys of the neighborhood. At 14 years of
age she again fell in love with a girl friend.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her current depression is due to a terrible disappointment.
She had maintained a love affair with
a French woman and was happy. She said nothing
about the character of the relations, but admitted
that they were very intimate. Suddenly she found
out that the French woman was not true to her, but
was keeping up intimate relations more often with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>other girls than with her. She suffered tremendously
on account of her jealousy. She began to
feel a disgust against all women not unlike her
former aversion to men. Asked why she was so
antagonistic to men, she answered: “Because they
are, all, without exception, disgusting brutes....”</p>

<p class='c004'>At this point Ilse begins to relate her past experiences.
She was seven years of age when she
visited an uncle. He showed her his big <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">membrum
virile</span></i> and asked her to hold it in her hand. She did
this as well as other things he requested her <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">usque
et ejaculationem</span></i>. “How shall I have any respect
for men when they don’t hesitate thus to poison the
innocent soul of a child?” The uncle is still living....
She has since thought that it must be some
morbid tendency and has forgiven him. “It happened
only a few times and the uncle believes I have
forgotten it....”</p>

<p class='c004'>Another traumatic incident impressed her more
seriously; it was, in fact, a series of traumas. Her
mother was a light-minded person and is so to this
day, despite her 50 years. But she knows enough
to dress herself so attractively and with such a display
of refinement that she is still capable of achieving
conquests. There follow a number of serious
complaints against the mother, which must have
been true, for I have had opportunity to convince
myself of the truth of some of the statements. The
mother always kept on the string a number of lovers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>who gratified her extravagant requirements. As a
child she had been taken along to a number of
rendezvous and has repeatedly witnessed the display
of tendernesses between the lovers. She also recalled
various household scenes from her early childhood.
As a child she was already very sensuous and masturbated
jointly with the sister and the brother.
She was precocious as well as prematurely spoiled
and every one thought she would early turn out to
be like her mother. Then her sister underwent a
great change in character. She became religious
and wanted to join a nunnery. She made fun of
her religious-minded sister but secretly admired her
for her chastity. She was 14 years of age at the
time. She now knows that she was in love with the
family physician and that she was interested in men,
but at the same time she was in love at different
times with various teachers and girl friends. When
her sister was 16 years of age she had a love affair
with an army lieutenant and had to go to a sanitarium
to be curetted, fever set in after the operation,
and for several weeks the girl was seriously ill.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her sister’s experience shook her to pieces. Inwardly
she had been proud that there was such a
pure, innocent girl in the family. Now that her
sister followed the example of her mother it seemed
to her that she, too, was fated to follow in the same
path and that there could be no escape for her.
During that period her character underwent a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>change and she acquired a tremendous dislike for all
small children. She could not suffer to see a small
child. She thought to herself, if she were its mother
she would strangle it. The feeling was so horrible
that she could not sleep. In time she improved
somewhat, but the dislike of children or, rather, the
fear of them, that is, the fear that she might do
some harm to them, never left her.</p>

<p class='c004'>I suspected that back of this feeling-attitude
towards the children might be found the solution of
her problem. I reverted back to her sixteenth year,
for it was at that period that she turned definitely
against all men.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why do you hate children?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not that, exactly.... In fact, I was at one
time foolish over them. I have always wanted children.
When I told you that I always played boyish
games it was not exactly the truth. I remember
now that I played nurse to my doll and that we often
played the game of childbirth. Brother was the
doctor and I was the pregnant lady in bed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did you happen to witness childbirth as a little
girl?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, everything.... Our aunt gave birth to a
child in our home,—a romantic story. An illegitimate
child; her parents were not to know anything
about the birth, or they would have disowned her.
But we children knew everything. Afterwards she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>married the man but was very unhappy with him.
The little baby was with us for a time. I was very
fond of it and carried it around....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you other such aunts in the family?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Between us: mother’s family has a poor reputation.
There were six sisters, each more flighty than
the next. None was a virgin at marriage. Things
were always happening and there was never any
peace. That is why I was so shocked over sister’s
experience. I was getting to think it was my fate
also to become&#160;... merely a prostitute. You will
pardon me for speaking so harshly about my own
mother. But unfortunately it is the truth....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A prostitute is purchasable.... There is some
difference whether one is light-minded through passion
or for gain.”</p>

<p class='c004'>(After a lengthy pause.) “Just what I did find
out at the time. Mother was to be had for money.
Father was a humble employee, an unsuccessful
jurist, who eked out a living doing secretarial service
for an attorney. He could not keep up with the
large household expenses even though he occasionally
transacted a business deal on the side which netted
him a considerable sum. Mother always had a
friend who took care of our needs. Thus we were
brought up rather well educated, my brother could
afford to study, we did everything.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did you know all that already as a child?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>“I knew it at a very early age....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You think, then, that your sister was also paid
and that she sold herself?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, nothing like that. In addition to the paying
lover mother always had one, a purely heart
affair, on the side. It was funny! The men always
brought us candies and all sorts of presents. When
we grew older mother became a little more careful.
Still, there was enough going on to bring shame as
I look back. And so there came into our house also
a young lieutenant whom mother had picked up—God
knows where. This fellow was mother’s avowed
lover and could do as he pleased. The terrible thing
was that he began to pursue also sister and after a
few jealousy quarrels mother had to put up with it,—she
perhaps even encouraged the affair. For I
overheard once a talk between them and heard
mother reproach ‘Shikki,’—that was the lieutenant’s
nickname,—that he had used sister. She could have
obtained a large sum of money for the girl because
she was a virgin and the girl would have been provided
for. Then there followed bitter quarrels between
mother and sister.”</p>

<p class='c003'>I interrupt the conversation at this point. It
turns out that she, too, was in love with the lieutenant,
and so were the others of the household,
including the father and the brother; she was also
jealous of her mother. Her jealousy opened her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>eyes. That is how it happened that she heard the
unpleasant rumors about her mother circulating
among the neighbors. She began hating her mother,
but that continued only for a short time. Then her
hatred turned to children. She hated first herself,
the child who bore no respect for the mother. She
did not want to be like her mother and her sister.
She knew that she would have to submit to similar
experiences; that her fate was sealed. She strove
against her feminine and motherly instincts. But
the analysis disclosed that she really entertained one
supreme wish which she was unwilling to countenance
openly: she wanted to be a mother and to bear many,
many children. But the neurotic reaction thwarted
her powerful motherly instinct. To be a mother
meant identification with the despised mother. Her
better feelings prompted her to draw herself far
apart from the mother.</p>

<p class='c004'>She did not want to be a woman. She did not
want to be so easy-going as her mother. At that
time her brother also showed a temperamental
change. He became serious-minded, began to write
verses, and to take an interest in all sorts of
idealistic endeavors. She linked herself to him and
before long she differentiated herself completely
from the rest of the household, and particularly
from the mother. She sought earnest-minded girl
friends and came into frequent contact with her
brother’s companions, but was unapproachable, even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>though she expressed herself freely and frankly
about all subjects. Her strongly sensuous temperament
threw her next into the arms of the
Frenchwoman and she preferred that to a love affair
with a man as she was afraid of children. After
the Frenchwoman’s breach of loyalty she fell into
her depression.</p>

<p class='c004'>This circumstance also disclosed an interesting
sidelight. She confessed to me that the Frenchwoman
was also her brother’s sweetheart. It had
never been mentioned by the woman but she knew it
even before she entered into intimate relations with
her. Nevertheless it was her happiest period.</p>

<p class='c004'>The depression is thus traceable to a second
source. The brother had abandoned the Frenchwoman,
having chosen another sweetheart, of whom
he was very fond and whom he intended to marry.
The Frenchwoman was only a sensuous play affair
with him, the brother belonged wholly to her. They
were always together and she knew all his secrets.
She was never jealous when she knew that he kept up
relations with some girl or woman so long as he did
not love soulfully. But now the brother became
acquainted with a wealthy, beautiful girl, with whom
he fell in love and whom he was going actually to
marry. This, for the brother, lucky event,—came
to nothing in the end on account of the opposition
of the girl’s family,—left her cool. All she saw was
that she was losing her brother, and that he no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>longer belonged to her. He could not marry the girl
because her parents required that he should first
prove his ability to support her. But the two lovers
agreed to wait for one another and the brother had
gone already pretty far and he may yet succeed
to marry the girl, despite the mother’s deplorable
reputation. He lives no longer with his family and
avoids the old home. He only sees her from time
to time and they are still good old pals, whenever
they meet....</p>

<p class='c003'>This interesting analysis illustrates all the chief
points to be found in the psychogenesis of male
homosexuality. In fact the girl was on the point of
becoming as fond of men as her mother, perhaps of
indulging in bisexual activities. Her sister’s experience
opened her eyes and acted as a terrible
warning. The yearning for purity which animates
every soul and is the polar counterpart of the desire
for tasting every sort of experience, became uppermost
in her case, the fear of becoming like the sister,
or like the mother, and her hatred of the mother,
jointly, had the effect of shaping her into a different
being. She probably would have not yielded to the
homosexual love of the Frenchwoman had she not
been overcome by the fact that the woman was her
brother’s sweetheart. It was a case of incest
through a third person.... She hated her mother
and had to protect herself against the danger of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>having children who grow up to be one’s enemies.
Thus children became her enemies. The father
played a negligible rôle in her life and had no influence
on the development of her homosexuality.</p>

<p class='c004'>I do not know well her subsequent history. Her
depression was soon relieved and her hatred of children
disappeared entirely. But she left Vienna and
went to another country, obviously to get away from
her family and to forget her whole past. I had
advised her to do so and the fact that she had followed
my advice permits us to hope that, after the
tempestuous course of her past life, she may have
succeeded, at last, in finding a friendlier harbor.</p>

<p class='c003'>Jealousy is the projection of one’s own insufficiencies
to the surroundings.<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a> It is an atavistic
awakening of the brutal sense of self such as was
common to the primordial man protecting his possessions.
All children are jealous. Jealousy leads
us back to the sources of man’s instinctive life.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is not my intention to take up the whole subject
of jealousy. But morbid jealousy shows certain
definite, almost regular, relations to homosexuality
which we must consider. We have seen that homosexuality
may be hidden from consciousness. That
is also true of jealousy. I have seen many neurotics
who have suffered tremendously on account of
their jealousy, without being aware of it. In the
masking of neurosis jealousy assumes most remarkable
forms.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next case illustrates the masking of jealousy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>its fusion with homosexuality, and contains various
points of psychologic interest:</p>

<p class='c003'>70. A highly intelligent subject, H. J., writes
me: “Have you already reflected on how we discern
certain similarities on certain days and fail to do so
at other times? You are undoubtedly aware that
neurotics and normal persons are fond of finding
resemblances when they formulate identifications.
The lover finds that the beloved walks like mother,
or that she talks like the latter, and if physically
no resemblance can be established he finds the same
mental characteristics, the same soul, perhaps the
same shortcomings. But I want to speak of an
entirely different peculiarity. One forenoon I see
a man, who looked enough like my friend, X, the
painter, to be taken for the latter. I walk up to
him and say: Hello, X,—still under the impression
of that mistake. A strange face wearing a beard
of familiar form is staring at me. I offer the usual
apologetic explanation and go my way. After a
while I see again my friend X, this time somewhat
dimly, not quite so certain of it as before. I recover
from this illusion quickly enough.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By that time my psychologic curiosity is roused
and it occurs to me that my wife told me that morning
she was going to visit the painter, X, during the
forenoon. I listened indifferently to the statement,
merely asking her to give him my greetings. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>a certain unrest must have risen in the unconscious:
your wife goes to the painter who likes her and
makes love to her. Nothing of that in consciousness
at all. Painters are a light-minded class who do
not take such things seriously. Who knows whether
your wife will be strong enough to resist?</p>

<p class='c004'>“These secret fears led to a symptomatic act. I
accosted a stranger as X, the painter. In other
words,—a wish fulfilment. For if I meet X on the
street he cannot possibly be in his studio at this
time. My wish is that he shall not be at home.
My wife shall go to the studio and find: Mr. X is not
in.... That wish came up on three different occasions
that morning. For I thought I saw Mr. X in
the street three different times. Moreover, I project
X upon strange faces. Because I think constantly
of X, because my mind is wholly preoccupied with
him, because I am innerly preoccupied with the uncountenanced
thought: what does X now do with
your wife?—I see X everywhere. <em>Ringstrasse</em> is
filled with men looking like him; every man is a
Mr. X.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The illusion at this juncture denotes also another
suspicion. An additional thought renders the first
one pregnant with significance. Yesterday I heard
the opinion expressed at a gathering, ‘Any woman
may be had and there is no such thing as a virtuous
woman!’ I opposed vehemently that cynical
thought (<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Pauschalverdächtigung</span></i>) and I tried to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>best of my ability to point out the ridiculous and
unfair implications of this notion. And today I am
surprised to find myself entertaining the thought.
These men who look like X, the great unknown, are
alike attractive and powerful men, just like X. You
are reflecting: Who knows whether this or that man
is not actually your wife’s lover? Why do the words
from Faust come into my mind: ‘<em>The whole town
has her’?</em>... In justice to my wife’s honor I must
now state that she is in fact an exemplary woman
and that I entertain no trace of suspicion about her
conduct. But I am deliberately looking for excuses
to vindicate myself. I mean to believe that every
woman is guilty, including therefore my own wife,
so as to justify in my eyes my new love affairs....
I am envious of X, of his free ways with women, and
would like to be in his place, receiving ladies in the
studio. I would like to be X. In my phantasy I
am X, and see myself as X in every stranger.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A lady of my acquaintance always saw her deceased
husband on the street in the person of some
stranger who seemed closely to resemble him. This
peculiar resemblance to strangers was noticeable
particularly when her mind turned to light and
frivolous thoughts. As if the image of the husband
came forward to warn and protect her: ‘It is only
three years since I have passed away and already
you begin to turn your mind to trivial joys? Beware.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>I watch you from Heaven and I see everything
you do.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>We admit freely that our subject is a keen-minded
psychologist possessing an extraordinary capacity
for introspection, yet this excellent piece of self-analysis
seemed to me to overlook something important.
I therefore write Mr. H. J. that I should
like to talk this interesting episode over with him
and I invite him to call on me. He accepts the invitation.
From our conversation I report only some
of the more important points:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Has it not struck you that the men who impressed
you as bearing resemblance were exclusively
attractive and powerful men?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, because my friend, X, the painter, is also
an attractive and well built man. Others would not
look like him....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you also otherwise jealous?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; not in the least; only about X,—and even
that I did not know or was perhaps too proud to
admit to myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is your attitude towards X? Do you care
for him also as you do...?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“... For my wife, you mean? I do. I love him.
He is a charming fellow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is it not strange that you should be jealous
precisely of the one man whom you also like so well?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He reflects a while and finds no answer. I explain
to him that it shows a repressed homosexual disposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>towards his friend. The trend of his unconscious
thought is: “<em>If I were a woman I could not
withstand him.</em>” Perhaps the thought goes even
further than that: “<em>Too bad I am not a woman for
then I would enjoy that beautiful man</em>....”</p>

<p class='c004'>He sees at once the relationship between his jealousy
and the unrecognized inner homosexual disposition.
He relates that this man is the only friend
whom he greets with a kiss after a prolonged absence,
that he likes to take him by the arm and to hold his
hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>In short, he himself is in love with his friend. He
sees his friend everywhere and the slightest resemblances
impress themselves strongly on his mind.
They are emanations from his one thought: <em>I like
him and I wish I were a woman to yield to him.</em></p>

<p class='c004'>It is very tempting to try to trace the various
paths of unconscious jealousy. But that would lead
us too far off our present theme. As we are confronted
with a very complicated condition which
may have the most varied roots I propose to give a
few clinical illustrations from my own practice and
to discuss the various forms of jealousy on the basis
of these data.</p>

<p class='c003'>71. The first case of jealousy which I had occasion
to observe was that of a physician’s wife. The
woman, 45 years of age, relates: “Perhaps you can
free me from a painful condition which embitters my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>whole life and turns my marriage into a veritable
hell. I have been married already 22 years and can
assert that I have not yet had a happy day except
when my husband is all day alone with me and we
have no occasion to come into contact with another
female person. He is a physician and already during
our engagement I was jealous of all his women
patients. I did not know this awful trait in myself
before. At any rate it was not so pronounced or I
should have not married my husband. At first I was
jealous of my immediate acquaintances and friends,
particularly of the very pretty women among them.
After marriage my condition grew worse and worse.
During the consultation hours I watched behind the
door and shivered with actual nervous chills in my
excitement. My husband was a woman specialist
and a very popular woman specialist at that. I
implored him to abandon that specialty and to take
up any other. I admit that the fact of his being a
woman specialist had at first excited my interest in
him and had a great deal to do with my choice of
the man. I thought to myself: the man sees so
many beautiful women, he sees them naked, and yet
has chosen you,—the thought flattered me immensely.
That was well enough at first, but later the feeling
of jealousy grew in its stead.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had a very pretty woman friend who was taking
treatment from my husband. What I endured during
her visits is beyond my powers to describe. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>said to myself: ‘She is now taking off her blouse and
now her petticoat. He is now examining, looking at
her bosom, and now she lifts herself upon the examination
table, she stretches her limbs apart....’
I suffered hellish torments. I was convinced that my
husband could not withstand this woman’s charms
and would kiss her. I had a serious quarrel with
him; I quarreled with my friend, who turned from
me with indignation. Our marriage relations grew
worse on that account. I tortured my husband so
that he had to allow me to watch through a carefully
hidden peep-hole what was going on in the consultation
room. In that manner I convinced myself
that my husband was physically true to me. But
even though he swore a thousand times that the
women did not excite him in the least I could not
believe him. I stuck to one thing which I harped on
daily: ‘<em>Give up your specialty.</em>’ Years thus passed
in quarrels and dispute. I have now a married
daughter of my own and I thought to myself that
with advancing age my condition would change.
But not at all! It grows worse and I transfer now
my jealousy also to my son-in-law, I am jealous for
my daughter. Fortunately, she has no real reason
to feel jealous and laughs at me....</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am also jealous of my daughter. I would like
to preserve her love for myself only and I begrudge
her husband. Although she made an excellent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>match, I was not satisfied and treated my son-in-law
very unfairly. I was unhappy over it but could
not help it. I have consulted already the most
famous specialists, have been for six weeks under
hypnotic treatment by Prof. X. I have already
kept away from my husband for three months at a
stretch,—nothing has helped.”</p>

<p class='c003'>That is the sufferer’s history. What is the
meaning of this jealousy?</p>

<p class='c004'>The root of this jealousy is a non-conscious homosexuality.
She is jealous of her woman friend because
she herself is in love with the friend. She puts
herself in the rôle of the man, the physician, and
concludes that in his position she could not resist
the temptation. She imagines herself in the man’s
place; she scrutinizes every woman with hungry
looks. The peep-hole in the consultation room
serves on the one hand the purpose of calming down
her jealousy and of giving the poor husband a few
quiet hours; on the other hand it enables her to participate
in everything that is taking place and to
gratify her craving as <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyeuse</span></i>. This control is her
daily homosexual excitant, the means through which
she rouses the flames of her passion only to still them
afterwards upon her husband.</p>

<p class='c004'>After the explanation was reached there was a
marked improvement in her condition. The woman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>saw that her love for the daughter was homosexual
and that this was the reason why she was so jealous
of her son-in-law.</p>

<p class='c004'>The occurrence is far from rare, and many a
marriage has been wrecked on account of it. The
angry mother-in-law is always the mother who cannot
live without her daughter and who wants to show
her daughter that the husband is untrue and does
not appreciate her and how much more she truly
loves the daughter.... I have also often seen the
daughter, after a timorous attempt at married life,
return penitently back to the mother. I have seen
mothers who fight for their daughters with a lover’s
passion and with their tremendous jealousy putting
all sorts of difficulties in the way of any pretenders
to the daughter’s hand. I have found that kind of
jealousy frequently as the root of melancholia. I
refer in this connection to Case 132 in my “<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Nervöse
Angstzustände</span></cite>” (2nd ed., p. 363).</p>

<p class='c003'>72. The next case of jealousy shows the same
roots. A married woman, 30 years of age, consults
me on account of an unexplainable jealousy which
has been torturing her for about four weeks. She
tells the story of her jealousy: She engaged a new
servant, a very young girl, somewhat coquettish, but
who at first glance seemed to her very sympathetic.
After one week she felt jealous and found that her
husband, who usually did not so much as look at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>servants in the house, was extremely friendly and
courteous towards that girl. It seemed to her even
that he was bestowing longing glances on the girl.
At first she kept silent because she hesitated to speak
of the matter to her husband. But after a time she
reproached him about it: he must be more strict.
She requested him to assume a more severe tone in
his relations with the girl. Her husband laughed
at her. He said he talked to the girl in his usual
manner and nothing more. It was all imagination
on her part. The girl was very good; he had no
reason to call her down or to assume a more severe
tone towards her. That reassured her somewhat
but only for a short while. She watched her husband
more carefully than ever and thought he was
much charmed by the girl. She arose several times
during the night to go into the servant’s room and
investigate. Once her husband had some gastric
trouble and he had to leave the room several times
that night. She was convinced that it was but an
excuse to go to the girl and several times she followed
him along the chilly passage into the hall, so
that her husband asked: “What is the matter with
you this time?” She said she was worried over his
condition and wanted to watch and see that he was
all right. Finally her jealousy broke to surface a
number of times and she reproached her husband
very bitterly with her suspicions. She was absolutely
certain that he was intimate with the girl.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Her husband was indignant and asked her to dismiss
the girl at once so that there might be an end to that
“foolish notion.” The remarkable thing was that
she felt unable or unwilling to dismiss the girl. The
girl was so good and so faithful, it is so hard nowadays
to find an efficient girl servant, she insisted
only that her husband must show himself more strict
with her. He had to declare on his oath again that
there was no intimacy between them. <em>Towards the
girl she felt a peculiar anger which she could not
understand. At times she could have flown at the
girl to strike her, which was very baffling as she had
never been in the habit of striking a servant. But
it would have been a great satisfaction to her to have
pummelled this girl who caused her so much anguish.
She had to restrain herself forcefully so as not to
give vent to her rage. She was very “touchy” with
the girl and tolerated not the least contradiction
on her part.</em></p>

<p class='c004'>Nevertheless she could not make up her mind to
dismiss the girl, and yet she was afraid to be alone
with her.</p>

<p class='c004'>All her troubles arose on account of her homosexual
attitude towards the girl who was in fact a
charming blonde type of beauty. She herself was in
love with the girl; that is why she could not conceive
that her husband might be indifferent towards her.
She figured: <em>If I were a man I would love this girl!</em>
Interesting, and at the same time typical, is her rage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>and desire to strike the girl. The love feeling is
converted into its opposite and the longing to touch
the girl (that is, to come into contact with her body)
manifests itself in the inclination to strike her. How
often love contacts disguise themselves as angry
blows under the mask of anger!</p>

<p class='c004'>I explain to the woman that she must dismiss
the girl when she saw clearly the meaning of her
jealousy. After the girl left all the unpleasant
symptoms mentioned above vanished.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another form of jealousy transfers itself from
one object to another, or to the whole surroundings.
Such transference of jealousy serves the purpose of
masking from self and from others the real object
of the original jealousy.</p>

<p class='c003'>73. Mrs. H. G. is a woman, 38 years of age, who
has been living happily with her husband. At present
she is unhappy on account of jealousy. Here
is her statement: “I have called on you to ask you
to relieve me of a condition which I find simply unbearable.
I have a good, fine husband against whom
I cannot complain of anything. He is a splendid
and model man in every way. I am the more distressed
therefore to be so jealous of him. I felt that
way, first, while my husband was ill with typhus
which left him with heart trouble. He has to be
more careful of himself because of the illness he has
been through, and whereas formerly he had intercourse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>with me two and three times a week, now it
happens only about once a month. My husband is
not well,—I know it; his physician has expressly
told me that he must keep very quiet and avoid all
excitement. Nevertheless I cannot help feeling that
he is untrue to me. I am so ashamed of it that I
have not yet breathed a word about my jealousy to
my husband. In fact, we are nearly always together.
I know all his affairs and I often go along
wherever he goes. But I cannot hang on to him
every minute. So I hold the watch in hand and
count the minutes, even the seconds, for him to
return. Always the one thought: <em>He is untrue to
you this very minute!</em> If he goes to another office,
I think he does it because there is a pretty office girl
there with whom he is in love. If he takes a meal
at a restaurant, it is because he has a <em>rendezvous</em>.
If he is a few minutes late coming home from the
office, he was with a street woman. In short, I am
tormented all the time by these evil thoughts, I
struggle against them but cannot put them out of
my mind.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How long have you been in that state?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It began when he went to Franzensbad on account
of his heart trouble. There he became acquainted
with a spinster, a girl 46 years of age,
who was also alone. They two got together and kept
each other company. I know the girl; she is very
honorable, and when my judgment is uppermost, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>say to myself: <em>Nothing has happened; the two have
merely felt a temporary intellectual interest in one
another.</em> But in my evil hours my mind conjures
up the worst thoughts. I have once read a letter
which that woman had written my husband. She
thanked him for his interesting company during the
cure. A few weeks after the Franzensbad cure, there
came a box of flowers and a letter for my husband.
The woman wrote thanking him for his pleasant
company during the cure,—she was very glad to
have made the acquaintance of so prominent and
intellectual a gentleman and hoped their friendship
would endure beyond the time of the cure. At that I
reproached my husband and tortured him with my
jealousy. He gave me his word of honor that his
relations with the woman were strictly of a friendly
and formal character; aside of his own considerations,
he was a sick man and satisfied to be left alone.
But I asked him to give up all further correspondence
with the woman and he readily consented. He
is really a fine fellow who grants me everything I
want, a man who reads in my eyes every wish of
mine, and I am ashamed to think ill of him all the
time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Here we see one source of her jealousy. The
woman was married to a man who gratified her in
every respect; suddenly she had to restrict herself
to an abstinent life. The enforced abstinence suggested
the thought: <em>You are still young and attractive,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>so many men are after you! Take a lover.</em>
She was filled with fancies of longing and projected
them unto her husband. If he were unfaithful it
would furnish an excuse for her. She needed it; she
wanted him to be unfaithful, for that would have
served her as a defense. Her compulsive thinking is
the masking of the thought: <em>Oh, that my husband
were unfaithful so that I, too, might take a lover!</em></p>

<p class='c004'>The thought was suggested to her by the fact that
the wife of one of her husband’s colleagues, a very
light-minded person, was able, nevertheless, to keep
up a very handsome social position. She spoke with
great feeling about that woman.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Does that woman not take loyalty so seriously
as you do?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That woman? She does not have one lover; she
has six at a time, and even more! She certainly
enjoys life. And the lovers pay for everything. She
has the finest wardrobe, the prettiest hats, takes
wonderful journeys and her husband knows everything.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Isn’t her husband jealous?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no! He knows everything, and consoles
himself in his own way. But, do you know the
curious part of it all? That flighty woman is
jealous of her husband! She quarrels bitterly with
him when she hears of his escapades, although she
has no right. The two have taken reciprocal
freedom....”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>This is also a common occurrence and very interesting.
Married couples living apart, each carrying
on all sorts of adventures and love affairs, yet
jealous of each other, though usually they do not
show it.<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a> There are persons who love each other
very warmly, but in the struggle between the sexes
they regard loyalty as submissiveness, as a humbling
before the partner, and they would perish
rather than submit to such a love.<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>Her calculating friend is a sophisticated woman
possessing wonderful tact, she tastes all forms of
pleasure, plays a certain social rôle, and enjoys
every phase of life. Moreover she is a very attractive
woman appealing strongly to our jealous subject.</p>

<p class='c004'>Back of her jealous thoughts, again, there stand
homosexual fancies. At the time when her husband
began to restrict his marital indulgences her homosexual
longing began to assert itself. She did not
want to be unfaithful. She was thus inhibited
against taking up a man. Therefore her thoughts
could only turn to woman. Her inner reflection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>was: <em>If I were a man, I would enjoy a pretty woman
every little while and more particularly that flighty
friend whom I like so well.</em></p>

<p class='c004'>The flighty woman had roused every feeling in
her. Not only her homosexuality, but also all those
prostituting tendencies which either slumber deeply
hidden in every woman’s soul or break to surface
before self and before the whole world. To be paid
for the service of love, to receive actual coin in
recognition of her sexual charm—that is a fancy
looming up under various cover-symptoms among
the neurotics.</p>

<p class='c004'>That polygamic friend of hers achieved everything
that a woman may wish, and in spite of that
she maintained her good social standing. She
moved in a select circle, folks merely shutting one
eye so long as she was so clever in covering her
tracks.</p>

<p class='c004'>That example is constantly before her eyes. She
herself is sexually ungratified, financially she can
hardly make both ends meet, and she sees the other
woman getting everything she needs: money and
love. The question, Does it pay to be honest?
continually recurs to her mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>She unburdens herself of a mass of similar reflections
but does not think that the real cause of her
jealousy depends on herself. She is jealous also of
the servant girl, the man-servant, and the children.
She is even jealous of her male friends. She has a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>certain good friend whom she put in touch, so to
speak, with a woman friend because he did not mean
anything to her. Since that time he has been keeping
up a close acquaintance with that woman and she
is very jealous; she would like to get him away from
her and to have him entirely to herself. She cannot
bear to see a child familiar with other persons and
is wild even when the servant girl receives a letter
or a show post card through the mail. <em>It is the perseverance
of the instinct of possession on account of
diminished sexual gratification.</em> She is reduced, so
to speak, to small rations and therefore wants to
accumulate and reserve for herself everything the
environment yields in the form of love. The little
she has she wants to preserve for herself only and
to protect as her own exclusive possession. The
same attitude is seen on the part of children who
have a favorite older brother or sister. They are
extremely jealous of their trifling possessions and
are enraged when the other children in the house
attempt to touch their toys. The others may have
more, but what little they possess they want to preserve
exclusively for themselves.</p>

<p class='c004'>The subject thus tells about her jealousy of
everything and everybody. But she displays but
little understanding of psychic relationships, she is
afraid to come to me because while at my office she
cannot watch her husband, and stays away a few
days. It seems as if she had something important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>to tell me but does not quite find the courage to
do so.</p>

<p class='c004'>Soon she calls at my office again complaining that
her jealousy grows worse; she suffered terribly that
day, and all through the previous night she had
hardly closed her eyes. And presently she confesses
that the jealousy actually began after the
death of her mother.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you know—dear doctor—my mother was the
model of a noble woman. She was virtuous, diligent,
well educated, sweet tempered, a veritable angel
in human form. In spite of it all—I don’t know
why—I was more strongly attached to father. Possibly
because he played more with us and paid more
attention to our games and excursions while mother
was more strict in her training and careful to inculcate
in us a sense of orderliness. Mother died
of a painful growth. I said to myself: ‘Now you
must take mother’s place with father. You must
take care of him.’ Father was already 62 years of
age, and suffered occasionally of gouty attacks. I
was tremendously shocked to see my father put
aside mourning after a few weeks and change into
an elegant man-about-town,—he the respectable
town official, who had never before gone a step
without mother.... He started to frequent nightly
disreputable dives and I soon heard that he
was having relations with various disreputable
women of the town. I was so disconsolate, in my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>anguish I visited daily mother’s grave. There I
threw myself to the ground and out of the bitterness
of my heart I implored mother and prayed to
her. ‘Mother,’ I cried, ‘you must not let this go
on, you must not allow your good name and honor
to be dragged down that way. Mother, put an
end to these shameful doings. Make father so ill
that he shall be unable to sin any more and besmirch
your memory.’ Thus I implored and prayed. But
it did not do any good. Soon I observed that
father was intimate with our young servant girl
and that she was trying to get hold of his money.
I drove her out of the house with the aid of the
police because I discovered that she was stealing
money from father. O, I was like a fury and irreconcilable
because the honor of my mother was at
stake, and I had ceased to respect my father who
had been the dearest person in the world to me!
After that I had peace for a few weeks because
father suffered one of his gout attacks. I prayed
to God and to the virgin mother to keep father confined
to his bed so that he should be able no longer
to add to his sins. But father got well soon and
resumed his former care-free nocturnal rounds of
amusement places. Chorus girls, dancers, street
women and others of that ilk gathered at our house
and were lavishly entertained. Then one day I
heard that father intended to marry again. He
had become engaged to a 42-year-old widow. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>knew at once that the woman had her eye on father’s
money. <em>I bought a revolver and, I tell you frankly:
I should have killed either the woman or my father
if there had been any marriage. Perhaps I would
have done away with both, for I was determined to
protect mother’s memory against this insult and
shame. I went to that woman’s house and gave her
such a warning that the engagement was soon given
up.</em> I told that shameless adventuress: ‘<em>You will
never reach the altar alive; that I swear solemnly
on mother’s memory!</em>’ I was fully determined to
shoot them both. You can appreciate how excited
I was.</p>

<p class='c004'>“After that father avoided me and my sisters. But
the proposed marriage did not take place,—I had
accomplished that much. I went no longer to his
house when he had suddenly a light stroke and was
forced to appeal to us children. Then we had a
complete family reconciliation and since that time
I have again my father. Now I see him daily, we
children take turns in looking after him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you no feeling of guilt and did you never
think that your father fell ill because you wished
it? Did you not want him to be so crippled and
reduced to your care that he should be able no
longer to carry on?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t feel guilty and I have no regrets. Only
satisfaction.... I wished it to be that way and it
has come out as I wished. For now I have once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>more a father of whom I need not be ashamed. But
you must not think that I was jealous on my own
account. I only felt myself the representative of
my mother.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are not jealous of your sister?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes&#160;... when father is very demonstrative
with her, I feel the same wild jealousy come over
me, but I control myself....”</p>

<p class='c003'>Here we see jealousy rising out of an incestuous
wish first directed upon a man, then transferred to
the whole environment. This transference of jealousy
to every one serves more effectively to cover the
genuine jealousy of the father. The death of the
mother left this young woman in a critical position.
Obviously her wish as a child was: “<em>When mother
dies I will marry father.</em>” A wish which so many
girls entertain and even openly express. With the
death of the mother the new situation presented itself.
A place close to father was vacated and now
other women filled it. The old father’s behavior
showed that he was still a man. But one thing stood
against this fancy: her husband. So long as he
lived she could not go to live with her father. Her
husband’s illness brought matters prospectively
nearer to an issue. The physician had declared
that he could not live long, his heart trouble was
serious. She might yet be free! Her agitation explains
a number of peculiar dreams she had. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>dreamed repeatedly of quarreling with her husband
and of striking him. <em>Several times already she has
beaten him up and she has even shot him in her
dreams. She is also unfair to the child, turning
against it with hatred on slightest provocation.</em></p>

<p class='c004'>We see that the jealousy of the husband also has
the rôle of legitimizing a hatred which has its roots
in other causes. For she confesses that during her
fits of jealousy, when she thinks that her husband
is unfaithful, she feels a bitter hatred against him
and could murder him.... The husband is in the
way, her hatred corresponds to the idea that he is
a hindrance. During the night the hatred breaks
forth but during the waking hours it is rationalized
as due to jealousy. For she admits that she has
really never fully loved her husband. Her affection
goes to her father. She imagines that she is fighting
for the preservation of her mother’s pure memory;
that furnishes an ethical cover and masks the
true motives.</p>

<p class='c004'>The relationship of this jealousy to homosexuality
is interesting. It furnishes an excellent proof
of our findings concerning homosexuality. One
must bear in mind, first of all, that many factors
contribute in this instance to bring about the regression
to the infantile level: her husband’s serious
illness, his relative impotence and abstinence,
her mother’s illness, the father’s change to a devil-may-care
attitude, showing her that one may change
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>even in late years, and that it is never too late fully
to enjoy the fruits of love. Her homosexuality was
always ready to break forth in her. She identified
herself with her father looking at women through
his eyes. She had protected herself at first by a
passionate love for her husband and minor various
trivial homosexual traits of her childhood were thus
readily overcome. Her swing to heterosexuality
was very successful with the aid of her husband.
Her homosexuality was repressed, only to reappear
at the beginning of the menopause,—woman’s critical
age. The involutive processes taking place in
the genital glands, and the general physical changes
in woman at the time play a certain rôle in that
connection. Her husband’s impotence and the
friend’s exciting example of her attractive friend,
with whom she herself was secretly in love, again
roused her homosexual feelings, though the attitude
showed itself only under the guise of jealousy.
But the father’s conduct, since her father was the
deepest cause of her aversion against man, was
what really made her lose her balance. She might
have become an <em>urlind</em>, had her father remained the
old, kindly, bland and quiet gentleman. But since
he abandoned the mask after the death of the
mother, he roused all the daughter’s evil instincts.
Not only the infantile erotic predisposition but the
infantile criminal tendencies as well. In her dreams
she murdered her husband who prevented her from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>turning entirely to her father and fulfill an infantile
wish to become her father’s wife. She also
repeatedly killed the children and her beloved
friends. This woman during her critical period
displayed not only the craving for love but also the
aboriginal emotion, the primordial stuff, out of
which everything beautiful and great has evolved:
hatred.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hatred against the other sex and against her
rivals, hatred against the children whom she could
have killed when anger seized her soul....</p>

<p class='c003'>74. This is the case of a 30-year-old woman,
victim of a remarkable form of jealousy. She is
jealous of her home, watching over it like one might
watch and protect a beloved. She has an older
sister who has been married for five years past and
lives outside Vienna. That sister was more to her
than her mother or any other friend. She looked
upon her as a second mother, confided all her secrets
in her and allowed herself to be guided and
advised by her at every step. She was supremely
happy in her companionship and desired nothing
better. She loved only that one sister,—towards
the other members of the family she was more or
less indifferent. Suddenly the family decided to
marry off that sister and an aunt brought a suitor
to the house. She found that suitor ridiculous,
unsuitable for the sister, and fought with all her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>limited powers against the match. But the mother
showed the greatest eagerness for an early marriage.
Then it happened that the girl awoke suddenly
in the night. Like a thunder a terrible
thought flashed through her mind: “<em>You must do
away with your mother!</em>” (It was the last desperate
soul cry in the attempt to hold on forever to her
sister. The mother was the original cause of her
misfortune. She could not live without the sister.)
The thought so shocked her, the subsequent regrets
over it kept her in a very depressed mood. She
developed a severe neurosis, consisting chiefly of a
series of punishments and expiations to which she
deliberately subjected herself. And shortly after
that she developed her jealousy of the home. Her
sister lived outside Vienna at a small place in Hungary
and occasionally came to Vienna. It was
natural that she should find a place in the comfortable
old home of seven rooms which the family
occupied alone. But the girl could not tolerate the
sister’s presence in the house. She became depressed,
began to cry, found that the furniture was being
abused and ruined, could not sleep nights, and
daily asked her sister: “How long are you going to
stay in town?” so that the sister cut her visit as
short as possible.</p>

<p class='c004'>This went on for several years. Year after year
the sister brought a new baby into the world and
she could not tolerate her sister’s children in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>old home. Every time a visit with the children
made her so seriously ill that finally the mother
begged the sister to find some other rooming place.
The children were hardly tolerated in the house;
they had to be kept in one certain room. The girl
was always afraid that something in the house would
be ruined. That this was not jealousy of her
mother is shown by the fact that it did not affect
her to have the mother visit the sister. In fact she
joined the mother readily on such visits and behaved
very pleasantly and quietly at her sister’s.
Only when it was a question of the old home she
became a storming avenging angel. Naturally she
also wanted to have her mother to herself. Her
boundless jealousy of the sister had apparently
disappeared altogether and had switched over to
the old home where the two had been once so supremely
happy. Thoughts of hatred against the
sister’s children and phantasies about doing away
with them, also occurred. She thought of a subtle
poison that could be given with the food in her
home. Perhaps she feared the presence of her sister
and sister’s children in the house for that very
reason and the fear may have been a protection
against her criminal tendencies.</p>

<p class='c004'>She had loved truly but one person: her sister.
The latter was everything in the world to her. She
called her the second mother, her friend, her beloved.
Her first thought when she awoke in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>morning was of her sister, the endeavor to please
her filled her life, and the last thing she did before
going to bed was to offer a prayer for her sister.
She was good and upright because she loved her
sister and because she felt happy that her sister
gave all her spare time up to her. She was trained
by her, they went on walks together, her sister
trained her heart. She was supremely happy and
wished nothing more than always so to live beside
her sister.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then came the engagement and her sister’s marriage.
Her heart bled at that terrible act of treason
and her feelings hardened. She hated everything,
she was against the whole world: against
the mother who instigated the match, against the
other sisters, who had also favored it, against the
brothers who did not oppose it. Only an old nurse
woman who had always stood by her and was her
staff of support, exceptionally escaped her hatred
remaining a sort of solitary ray of affection. But
the house was filled with memories of the beloved
sister. The pieces of furniture were mute but eloquent
witnesses of her former happy love state.
They should not be profaned by the presence of the
unfaithful, changed sister! She hated the children,
wishing they were dead and at the same time she
was afraid she might hurt them. Two souls
struggled in her breast: one a criminal, the other
ethical. The sight of the children was repulsive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>to her. They bore the traits of the sister and of
the man who had stolen her away.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her whole possessions consisted now of her memory
and the household goods, the old rooms furnished
the necessary real background for her phantasies.
“Memory is the only paradise from which
we cannot be driven out,” said <em>Jean Paul</em>. Her
residence became to her a temple of memory, a
sanctuary where every piece of furniture recalled
the past happiness in which she still projected
herself. For her days passed in dreaming
and weaving of fancies. She idled away sweet hours
and days continually dreaming only of her sister.
Criminal fancies of poisoning all the others finally
led her, by way of punishment, to fear poisoning.
She quit eating anything at the table, as she formerly
did. She suspected poison in every food. She
began to vomit after her meals. She kept away
from everybody except one woman friend who stuck
to her faithfully and who shared her revulsion of
feeling against the sister. She lived continually in
fear she might kill her mother because the imperative
(kill her!) kept cropping up all the time. She
avoided men. All attempts to interest her in some
man eventually to get her married off proved fruitless....</p>

<p class='c004'>The home was her temple which must not be
soiled. All her devotion and her affection were centered
daily on that spot.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>The case approaches closely the realm of psychosis.</p>

<p class='c004'>After a course of psychoanalysis lasting about
one half year she improved a great deal. She was
able to tolerate her sister’s visits, was free of the
obsessive thought of killing her mother, was again
able to eat any food and her “nervous” vomiting
ceased altogether. A very favorable offer of marriage
she rejected. She still avoided men as resolutely
as ever.</p>

<p class='c004'>We turn to the next case.</p>

<p class='c003'>75. Mr. R. T., a well-known poet, only 31 years
of age, is also a victim of morbid jealousy and has
already experienced very serious conflicts on that
account. He was always fixed on his family and
lived exclusively for his parents and other members
of the immediate family circle. He clung particularly
to the mother, with worshipful affection. At
18 years of age he began to fall in love with all his
friends’ “girls.” He even fell in love with a street
woman whom his best friend often visited. Already
at that time he showed a strong jealous streak and
he asked that woman to give up her unfortunate
way of living. (That is a typical experience with
young fellows who are fixed on the mother. They
seek out a polar obverse to their mother’s character
and associate with that person a fancy of being
the savior. The savior phantasy covers, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>to my investigation, merely the wish to save
one’s self....) He was soon through with this
love affair, although it had broken out with great
passion, and had to leave Berlin because he could
not get along with his parents. He always quarreled
with his mother and that interfered with his
creative work.</p>

<p class='c004'>Meanwhile he became very famous and was earning
a very comfortable income. He fell into the
habit of spending his nights at restaurants and
other amusement places in the company of friends
and of returning home in the early morning hours.
He woke up at noon and wrote a few hours during
the afternoon,—that was his only work.</p>

<p class='c004'>At a certain cabaret he became acquainted with
a girl who was in charge of the bar. She was 35
years of age at the time, but gave her age as 28,
and in fact looked much younger than she was. He
began having relations with that girl, looking upon
the affair as a trivial adventure, at first. He knew
that she was being supported by a Count but this
did not prevent him from allowing her to choose
him for her “heart love.” He was tremendously
flattered that this girl, or perhaps we would better
say, this woman, preferred him to all others and
loved him so disinterestedly. His affection grew
daily, also her love for him. She finally gave up
her Count and told our young man that she
loved him only, and would never again give herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>to any other man. It made him very happy;
they rented lodgings together. But soon he requested
her to give up her position at the bar, because
there she came into too close contact with
men. She did that very willingly. Before they
had taken up lodgings together he had asked her
to give him a complete history of her past life. She
told him a very romantic life history and mentioned
four men who had had sexual relations with her.
(As a matter of fact dozens of men had cohabited
with her.)</p>

<p class='c004'>He was madly jealous of these men. She had to
repeat to him the story of her past over and over,
then he became angry, also sexually very excited,
figured how he would revenge himself on his rivals,
how he would beat them, box their ears or shoot
them down in a duel or cut them up with his sword;
his rage against the unfortunate woman grew all the
time, he scolded her, called her every bad name,
threatened to leave her at once, struck her, and in
the end had intercourse with her, experiencing powerful
orgasm.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before long he began to be troubled with the
uncertainty whether she had told the whole truth.
He investigated her past, looking up questionable
episodes. A detective was engaged to watch her
during his absence and to look up her past. The
fellow quickly picked up the gossip of the neighborhood
and reported the talk as true. Besides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>the adventures frankly confessed to him a number
of other liaisons were traced, which the woman had
failed to mention. She also had to admit that she
was older than she had held herself out to be.</p>

<p class='c004'>There followed years of terrible torture and continual
torture. First thing in the morning he began
to wonder who else among his acquaintances or
among strangers may have possessed the woman.
He questioned her persistently, his rage growing,
he made her take a solemn oath, then he struck her
and tried to extract from her a forced confession.
In vain she implored him, begging him to realize
that she was not responsible for her past, that she
did not know him at the time, that she was but a
child when she already had to support the whole
household and a sick mother; nothing helped, he
was implacable.</p>

<p class='c004'>When his investigations led accidentally to the
discovery of another man who had not previously
figured in the list of her adventures he threw a glass
at her head and hurt her so seriously that she was
ill several weeks. He sought quarrels with her
former sweethearts and challenged them on the least
provocation, wounding several in duel, as he was
an excellent duellist.</p>

<p class='c004'>Finally the lovers separated. The woman could
stand it no longer and threatened to take her life.
But, in a few weeks she fell ill and had him called
to her sick bed. Another time the reverse occurred.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>In short—the pair could not keep away from each
other. It was the last love of this woman who had
lost her early first charms. Through this love she
hoped to save herself and either marry or attain the
quasi-respectability of a similar state. But he had
entered this relationship lightly as he had done in
similar cases and he now suddenly found himself
entangled in a tight net which isolated him from
the world. For he did not dare to go out with her.
He always had the unpleasant thought he might
meet one of her former lovers,—he even watched
the faces of all passers-by to see whether they did
not laugh at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had a friend who was very devoted to him.
That friend hated his partner, because she had
robbed him of his best friend. That friend was his
complete slave. He became the poor woman’s guardian.
But the friend had a peculiar passion. He
desired to possess all women who belonged to his
friends. (This is a transparent homosexual mask
as I have already pointed out in the present work.)
Therefore he made love also to this woman, who
planned her revenge by apparently accepting his
advances and when she had in her hands proofs of
the fellow’s intention, she turned the proofs over to
her beloved. A terrible scene ensued, including revolver
shots, but fortunately no one was hurt.</p>

<p class='c004'>Next he began to torment the woman regarding
her relations with that friend. He obviously looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>for an excuse to break with her, and solemnly resolved
to leave her for good if he should discover
the least thing out of the way in her conduct. But
she was so cowed by his snares that she did not
dare to go out on the street alone....</p>

<p class='c004'>The motives of his conduct are clear. We have
here a pronounced case of homosexuality manifesting
itself as jealousy of other men. The thought
that this or that other man had possessed her is
precisely what constituted the woman’s highest
charm in his eyes. When the man declares that he
would have been happy if he could have met this
woman in her virgin purity, he is mistaken. He
will always seek the street walker, the disreputable
woman. She is the more charming because she is
older than he. For he is longing for the mother
<em>Imago</em> and therefore he is most happy, too, when
she mothers him. Like most homosexuals he is
strongly attached to the mother. But unlike the
overt homosexuals he has not carried out his flight
all the way to the male, but has fled, instead, to
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">puella publica</span></i>, the dishonored woman....</p>

<p class='c004'>He would like to get rid of this woman. But he
has become more deeply enmeshed with her through
his feeling of guilt on account of the wound he had
caused her and which had left an ugly scar on her
face. Since he wishes she were dead in order to be
free of her, his conscience indissolubly binds him
tenfold to his victim. His criminal fancies center
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>continually on the poor tortured woman and her
former lovers. Under the mask of his jealousy he
gives free rein to his criminal fancies. In addition,
like most artists he is very superstitious and
believes that the woman had brought him good luck.
Since he has her, he has created his best work and
under the inspiration of the strong excitement, he
has achieved his best results. It thus seems that
the relationship is fixed for life and he may never
be able to give it up....</p>

<p class='c004'>Naturally there are also other forms of jealousy.
But when it appears in this pathologic form, it is
never difficult to trace the homosexual factor and
with it the criminal tendencies back of it. The last
case given above is particularly convincing and the
friend’s behavior very characteristic.</p>

<p class='c004'>Our subject feels impelled to think of the woman’s
lovers driven thereto by his homosexual longing.
He thinks of them in a roundabout way, so to speak,
through and around the woman. Jealousy enables
him to dwell on the picture of the naked man; he
thinks of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">phallus</span></i> of his rival, compares it with
his own; he drinks in the bliss which his beloved must
have tasted through another man; he places himself
entirely in the woman’s rôle, so that, in his
fancy, he is the woman. He hates the woman in
himself and transfers that hatred upon his second
self, his beloved. He hates the woman also because
she cannot successfully substitute the man for him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Before that liaison he spent his nights in cafès and
wine rooms in the exclusive company of men. He
no longer does that. He does not leave his beloved
alone any more, thus lacking the excitation of manly
company. He tortures his mother as he does his
beloved whenever he goes home for a few days. He
loves her so dearly that he cannot live through a
day without calling her up from Vienna all the way
to Berlin, where she lives, to talk to her. If he is
somewhere where he cannot be reached by telephone
his mother must wire him daily. It is very interesting
how this love of the mother covers the deeper
love of the father. He plays the love of his mother
as his trump card against the father. He flees from
the sexual love of the father, while yet he has been
repeatedly conscious of his incest phantasies towards
the mother. He always adds to his mother
<em>Imago</em> some kind of a father. He was most jealous
of an attorney, already grey haired and a married
man, who therefore stood as a symbol of the father.
He has even gone so far as to look up that man
to demand an explanation from him, thereby making
himself ridiculous. His jealousy was particularly
suitable as a means for his latent sadism to
become manifest. It enabled him to dwell on bloodcurdling
phantasies, it made it reasonable for him
to injure his beloved sweetheart, and to justify that
insane deed as due to excess of love. The analysis
brought about a distinct improvement in the situation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>He joined again his comrades at the public
houses and peace was seldom disturbed after that.</p>

<p class='c004'>How difficult it is at times to ferret out the homosexual
root of jealousy in such situations is shown
by the next case, in which jealousy is again masked
before the subject’s consciousness.</p>

<p class='c003'>76. Miss K. N. consults me for a peculiar
trouble about her sleep. She is extremely sensitive
to noise. She lives with her sister who keeps a very
small apartment where one little room is rented to
a gentleman. Her nervousness consists of uncontrollable
reflections, as soon as evening begins, about
the lodger’s return home. If he returns and goes
to sleep early, she herself is soon quiet and sleeps
well through the night. But if he is away, she cannot
sleep. She may fall into slumber but sleeps so
lightly that she is awake at the least noise until
she hears the lodger return at last to his room.
Then a terrible feeling of dread comes over her and
her heart begins to beat fast. Other noises also
seem to disturb her. The house in which she lives
is near a railroad track. But the trains do not
disturb her, nor the electric cars. But voices in
the next room, and the sound of steps on the floor
above, keep her awake.</p>

<p class='c004'>One would suppose that she wishes the lodger
would come to her and is afraid of that. But she
insists that the gentleman is indifferent to her, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>would not kiss him if he gave her millions in money
for it. She is an unlucky person. She will undoubtedly
have to give up her sister’s lodging. She
has already had a similar experience. She was the
mother’s favorite, petted and fondled in every way.
Her mother had a stroke of paralysis and lost consciousness.
After she came to herself, she clung
to the delusion that her favorite child had turned
untrue to her and began terribly to torture the poor
child.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a> She reproached her with occurrences wholly
imaginary, scolded her as being cold, selfish and indifferent.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>The girl could do nothing and finally had
to leave the house and go to live with strangers.
She returned home only after the death of the
mother. Meanwhile the father had also passed
away. The two girls remained alone in the world
and now only had each other. But things were at
sixes and sevens between them and they seldom had
a quiet hour between themselves.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last the sister became actually abusive. She
begged her sister “with uplifted hands” to dismiss
the lodger. She was willing to cover the room rent
out of her own pocket. She could not stand it any
longer. She could not sleep nights and was going
physically and mentally to pieces. But the sister
became wild and started to scold her, using the same
terrible terms which she had heard her mother hurl
at her. They rushed at each other’s hair. She was
so enraged she could have strangled her sister at
the time.</p>

<p class='c004'>After that scene she came again to me in despair.
I advised her to move out. She cannot have everything
her way and she must have quiet. But what
was her answer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That I cannot do. I cannot.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why not? Does not your sister let you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh no, it isn’t that&#160;... only yesterday sister
said to me: ‘Move out. I will cherish the day when
I will get rid of you.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you stand for that?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“I cannot move out because....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are in love with your sister and cannot live
without her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s it. I cannot live without sister and even
her scoldings and her angry words I will put up
with rather than stand a day without seeing her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Still you will have to do it.... The conditions
are unhealthy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.... Only yesterday I said to sister: ‘<em>I am
going to move out and you can keep your rooms and
do with your lodger whatever you want. I won’t
protect you any more.</em>’”</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus it came out clearly that she was watching
every night, whether the lodger was going to the
sister and that she dreaded moving out because she
knew that the sister would then be alone with the
lodger in the house and he could go to her every
night. I made this clear to her but she did not seem
to see it at first. She admitted her homosexual love
for the sister....</p>

<p class='c004'>She moved to other quarters. It was a quiet
little room over a garden in the home of an elderly
woman living alone. But here also she could not
sleep. The old woman snored and she could not
stand that. Then the ticking of a clock disturbed
her continually and kept her from falling asleep,
the striking of the hours even waking her up. She
thus continually sought everywhere for the reasons
of her unrest which were only in herself. The palpitation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>of her heart (symbolic substitute for it:
the clock) gave her no peace. She looked for other
quarters, kept looking and looking but found no
place so satisfactory and quiet as the sister’s lodging.
She went there every evening returning to her
outside lodgings late in the night. She took advantage
of a light illness of her sister’s as an excuse
and returned to her little room, again shivering with
dread whenever the lodger was late coming home.
Even after she chose for herself a lover who gave
her complete sexual gratification her quiet was temporary.
The heterosexual component of her instincts
drove her more and more to her lover trying
to forget her sister in his arms. But she succeeded
only intermittently and her thoughts kept revolving
again and again between her sister and that lodger.
Finally her sister gave in and the lodger had to
move. An elderly young woman became the new
lodger. Then she quieted down and was able to
sleep once more.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is interesting that nearly all narcotic drugs
not only proved useless but made her worse. She
did not want to sleep so as to keep watch over her
sister’s virtue.</p>

<p class='c004'>As in all the cases previously mentioned, here,
too, developments led to overt attitudes, the subject
stood on the brink of criminal passional deeds.
Hatred and love showed intimate relationships. She
was also afraid of murderers, barricaded the doors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>and shivered at every little noise. That was the
fear of her own criminal thoughts. Her infantile
criminal tendencies arose with her infantile love for
the sister.</p>

<p class='c004'>This case, like the former, illustrates the inner
relations between jealousy, homosexuality and sadism.
For during her fits of anger she entertained
terrible thoughts of revenge. She thought of burning
down the home; of killing her sister, as well as
herself, by turning on the gas in the room; she tried
to secure a revolver, supposedly as a protection
against thieves. Her dreams show a criminal personality
in sharp contrast to her customary mild
character. Emotionally the criminal in her was
much more powerful than her cultural self, she could
have assaulted her sister and once actually drew a
knife. After such emotional outbreaks she crumpled
and became again the quiet, soft girl, beloved of
everybody on account of her good nature.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is very striking that the feeling of jealousy
breaks through all the barriers of culture. Extraordinarily
frequent are suspicions of incest,<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a> of homosexuality,
of masturbation, and zoöphily. Women
accuse their husbands of relations with their
daughter; or they accuse the man of homosexual
relations with a friend. Men bring similar accusations
against their wives. All such accusations
are projections of subjective sexual tendencies
upon the object of their jealousy. <em>Beaussart</em> (<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La
Jalousie; Annales Psychiques</span></cite>, vol. LXXI, 1913),
who maintains erroneously that morbid jealousy is
more frequent among men than among women,
brings out very strongly this peculiarity of jealousy
and bases it on the absence of true motivation. But
the motivation is transparent enough. Among the
cases reported by him I note that of a 75-year-old
woman who tortured her husband to death with her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>groundless jealousy and who, in a rage, one day,
attacked him with a razor. Jealousy is clearly a
rationalization of hatred, it harks back to the primary
egoistic attitude of the aboriginal man. The
phyletic raw sexuality and criminality corresponds
to man’s primary ontogenetic attitude towards his
environment.</p>

<p class='c004'>Other jealous persons see their criminal tendencies
reflected in the surroundings. A jealous person
has the hallucination that the supposed lover
of his wife intends to knife him. In this manner the
killing of the lover looms up as a logical necessity.
Whereas men make use of swords, revolvers, whips,
tortures and shackles, woman’s criminality breaks
out in such jealousy acts as anonymous letters, libel,
poisoning, castration and throwing of acid (<em>Beaussart</em>).</p>

<p class='c004'>In many cases the barrier between jealousy and
insanity, between neurosis and psychosis, is hardly
to be distinguished. Often jealousy is the first
symptom of paranoia.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next two cases have also pronounced paranoiac
features. We are indebted to <em>Freud</em> for his
significant contributions to our understanding of the
nature of paranoia, or <em>paraphrenia</em>, as <em>Freud</em> terms
the condition. In his fundamental contribution,
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Psychoanalytische Bemerkungen über einen autobiographisch
beschriebenen Fall von Paranoia</cite>
(<cite>Sammlung kleiner Schriften zur Neurosenlehre</cite></span>, 3rd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>ed., Franz Deuticke, Leipzig and Vienna, 1913), he
has shown that paranoiac insanity is traceable back
to the repressed homosexual components of the sexual
instinct. The persecution ideas of paranoiacs
(by men) is the projection outward of their own
thoughts. The subject is pursued by his own homosexual
phantasies and out of those fancies he constructs
his notion of a pursuer. Love is transmuted
by the subject into its bipolar opposite, hatred.
<em>Freud</em> states on this point:</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘I do not love him, in fact I hate him.’ This
contrary attitude, which cannot mean anything else
in the unconscious does not assume that form in
the paranoiac’s consciousness. The mechanism governing
the formation of symptoms in paranoia requires
that the inner apperception,—the feeling of
subjection,—should be replaced by some perception
from without. The proposition: ‘in fact I hate
him,’ is thus changed through projection into another:
‘he hates (pursues) me which consequently
justifies me in hating him.’ The unconscious feeling-motive
thus appears as though it were an objective
perception, a deduction:</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘<em>I do not love him, in fact I hate him, because he
pursues me.</em>’”</p>

<p class='c004'>Observation leaves no doubt that the pursuer is
none other than the formerly beloved person.</p>

<p class='c004'><em>Freud</em> here overlooks entirely the relations of
paranoia to criminality. Having persistently overlooked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>thus far the tremendous significance of latent
criminality in the psychogenesis of neurosis and having
emphasized only the sexual factors underlying
all psychotic and nervous manifestations, he neglects
here also the important rôle of criminality in
the dynamics of paranoia. That is the reason why
his explanation does not fit all cases. For there is
also a paranoia which stands for a flight from criminality,
even representing a rationalization of criminal
tendencies without any homosexuality. Such
cases are exceptional but they do occur. The fear
of insanity which oppresses so many neurotics, involves
as a polar component the wish to lose one’s
mind. For the insane is responsible neither to himself
nor before the law. “He cannot help it.” That
is why paranoiac conditions break out so often with
the commission of some crime. On the other hand
the paranoiac turns insane as a defence against committing
a crime. We shall yet find that isolation in
an asylum for the insane corresponds with many
a victim’s hidden wish, because there they find peace
of mind and security.</p>

<p class='c004'>The jealousy of paranoia like every other form
of jealousy is an expression of rage. But <em>it serves
to rationalize the anger and lends force as well as a
measure of emotional justification to the criminal
impulse</em>. Many crimes of passion, so-called, are
caused by the passion for crime. We have as yet
penetrated but little through the mask which covers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>the inner criminal. We are still too anxiously concerned
with the superficial motivations which bring
about sadism to find the path leading towards the
fundamental fact. The best measure of culture is
the manner in which the man’s primordial character
manifests itself in us, our conscious conduct. That
is why the advancement of culture is bound to lead
to an increase of insanity in the proportion that
the jails are emptied.</p>

<p class='c004'>I must again point out that <em>Juliusburger</em> was the
first to recognize and describe clearly these relations.
In fact the credit of having discovered the relations
between homosexuality and paranoia belongs to him.
In his work entitled, “<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Homosexualität im Vorentwurf
zu einem deutschen Strafgesetzbuch</span></cite>” (<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Allgemeine
Zeitschrift f. Psychiatrie</span></cite>, 1911), he already
stated:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Furthermore we find in the insane the well-known
delusion of persecution and its motive is often derived
from homosexuality inasmuch as the patients
complain that they are pursued with homosexual
intent, of which they themselves disclaim any guilt.
Or, in their morbid state of mind, they believe themselves
victims of persecution because it is proposed
that they should be driven into the alleged ranks
of homosexuals, something they resent most scornfully.
In both cases we see a peculiar psychic process
which must be conceived as a projection to the
surroundings, to the world of external reality, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>unconscious subjective notions. When an individual
breaks down mentally complaining to be a victim
of watchfulness and persecution for alleged homosexual
purposes, the condition may be explained
only in the sense that the individual in question
actually harbors within himself a powerful homosexual
tendency and the latter is projected unto
the world of external reality through a peculiar
mental mechanism. The old proposition: <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex nihilo
nihil fit</span></i> holds true also of the mental sphere and it
would be utterly unscientific to fail to recognize in
this sphere as well the law of strict causality or
motivation. A careful examination of the mental
life of our insane man’s unconscious shows that
homosexuality is a powerful motive force much more
frequently than is ordinarily recognized and this
attempt to turn the unconscious subjective feeling
of homosexuality into an objective reality, constitutes
a pathway for the release of inner psychic
tension, so a means for the individual to escape the
feeling of guilt roused by his erroneous perception
of facts and to pass the responsibility onto other
shoulders. Many of the insane notions of our patients
become intelligible and we grasp their meaning
only when we recognize the powerful rôle which
homosexuality plays in man’s unconscious.”</p>

<p class='c004'><em>Juliusburger</em> also recognizes the significance of
sadism and its tremendous rôle in the psychogenesis
of the delusion of jealousy. In his contribution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>referred to previously, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“<cite>Zur Psychologie des Alkoholismus</cite>”
(<cite>Zentralblatt f. Psychoanalyse</cite>, Vol. III,
1913</span>), he makes the following relevant observations:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I agree with <em>Freud</em> that the homosexual or homopsychic
component of man and woman finds one
of its outlets, as sublimation, in the form of companionship
and social drinking. But thus far I
remain unconvinced that homosexuality or its
psychic substitute plays also a similar rôle in the
pathogenesis of the delusion of jealousy. Therefore
I still adhere to the view expressed by my colleague,
<em>Hans Oppenheim</em>, in his contribution, “<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zur Frage
der Genese des Eifersuchtswahns</span></cite>” (published in:
<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zentralblatt f. Psychoanalyse</span></cite>, 1911). As formerly
I still regard the sadistic-masochistic instinctive
cravings as the strongest root of the delusion of
jealousy. I found particularly instructive a certain
case in which sadism broke forth in a jealous
drinker more quickly than I had ever seen that happen
before. This man’s sadism manifested itself
concurrently in an incredible cruelty to dogs which
could be only explained by his sadism. The oft-recorded
fact that the jealous drinker is not satisfied
and does not release his victim even after the
latter, in an attempt to quiet him, submits to some
disgusting act, the continual repetition by him of
tortures and cruelties, may be explained only as due
to a deeply rooted sadistic impulse everlastingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>craving gratification. The delusion of jealousy is
rooted in sadism, the overstressed images accompanying
the morbid feeling of jealousy are generated
by the sadistic tendency. Sadism is the fertile
soil giving rise to the delusions of persecution
of the jealous alcoholics, and intimately linked with
sadism stands masochism, upon which the feeling
of jealousy feeds and grows.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Besides the sadistic-masochistic components the
pathogenesis of the delusion of jealousy displays
also the transposition of a certain feeling of guilt.
In my cases at least it was easy to prove that the
jealous drinker who forces his wife to commit some
punishable offence, is himself inclined to carry out
the incriminating acts and controls himself only
with difficulty. I found a similar situation in the
case of women, victims of delusions of jealousy.
The more or less conscious projection of their feeling
of guilt upon the partner brings on mental release
and a certain sense of freedom, and at the same
time furnishes new fuel for the sadistic impulse.
Finally for the explanation of the delusion of
jealousy we must take into consideration also another
factor which may be explained on the basis
of atavism. We shall see later that certain atavistic
reminiscences play a great rôle in the psychology
of alcoholism. The will to power, the yearning to
dominate and subdue woman still lies dormant in
man’s soul,—a remnant from old. The soul of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>alcoholic is particularly prolific in atavistic remnants
which show themselves upon close analysis
and, besides, the chronic intoxication rouses the
<em>dormant atavistic trends</em> which lie dormant at the
bottom of the soul and brings them to surface. The
aboriginal tyrannical self awakens in the drinker
and flays a controlling whip over the cowering woman;
in the case of female victims of the delusion of
jealousy the reverse happens and the primordial
matriarchal instinct becomes manifest. We learn
progressively to see and appreciate how atavistic
remnants break to the surface in the psyche of the
insane.”</p>

<p class='c004'>That conception of jealousy as the “projection
upon the surroundings of a subjective feeling of
inadequacy” was at one time my starting point in
my characterological investigations of jealousy.
But I soon learned that the problem is much more
complicated. When I found that the neurotics represent
regressive stages of development, I conceived
jealousy to be a primitive feeling of hatred, characteristic
of man in his primordial state. Paranoia
discloses the primary tendencies which are glossed
over by our cultural development. One’s true character
betrays itself in one’s emotions. Jealousy
shows us the true inner man in all his passionate
cravings and his hidden desires.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next case illustrates all the characteristic
features: the delusion of persecution, the morbid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>jealousy and the brutal sadism. There is no insight
into the condition. The feeling of jealousy is
adjudged as justified. Ridiculous incidents are held
forth as grounds for suspicion in order to remove
from self the sense of guilt. All the alleged “persecutions,”
which are looked upon as dangerous, lack
any objective grounds. Often sadism breaks
through, though under the guise of emotional
paralogisms.</p>

<p class='c003'>77. Mr. A. W., a manufacturer, 29 years of age,
consults me for anxiety, a condition which has
already plunged him into very unpleasant situations.
His anxiety broke out in Tyrol the first
time. He wanted to meet a certain party and asked
his landlord for directions. The latter conducted
him personally over the road, which was a very
rough and badly neglected one. Suddenly the man
saw in front of him some suspicious-looking persons.
But he controlled himself, although he surmised
they were tramps if not a gang of highwaymen.
Next he saw a number of men on the hill
hurrying in his direction. At that he broke into a
run, and kept running as fast as he could. A shot
rang out in the distance, intended for him.... He
reached the valley, out of breath, and reported the
occurrence to the officer. The latter shook his head
and did not even care to question the landlord, who
explained that he had merely conducted the gentleman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>through a short cut in the road which is also
used by hunters. That short cut leads to the next
broad highway. But A. insisted that all was not
well and that an attempt had been made to hold him
up. The officer said that in his 30-year experience
such a thing had never happened in that locality.
But A. remained unconvinced and to this day he
believes that he had narrowly escaped a hold-up.
That might be thought possibly true if the occurrence
stood alone. But he had very many such
experiences. During a journey through Sweden he
saw the hotel proprietor talk in subdued tones in
Swedish with a number of guests who thereupon
stared at him queerly. There was no key to his
room and the room could not be locked. He could
not sleep and kept peering through the window.
Then he saw a number of queer fellows foregathering
in the hall. He could not stay longer in that
house. The owner told him that as he had engaged
the room he would have to keep it. They could not
come to an understanding. He saw an officer passing
by and called upon the representative of law to
help him extricate himself. The officer knew a few
German words, he stepped in, and they went to the
police station together, and there a record was
made of his remarkable adventures. He left his
lodgings a third time on similar grounds. On his
excursions he always carries a revolver and that
gives him a certain sense of security.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>It is easy to diagnose this as a case of paranoia.
The absence of insight after the emotional episodes
shows the psychotic character of the trouble. A
victim of anxiety neurosis may have similar experiences.
But afterwards, perhaps only a few
hours after the occurrence, he says to himself: “It
was nonsense,” and is ashamed to speak of it later.
But this man dwells on his adventures trying to convince
me of the dangers he has gone through.</p>

<p class='c004'>The notion of being watched and pursued is a
product of his homosexual leaning which he is unable
to control. We inquire into his personal habits and
past life and find that his mother died when he was
very young and his father assumed also the place
of a mother to him. With his father he maintained
a sort of “spiritual marriage” relationship up to a
few months ago. They always went out together,
never one without the other, and they slept in one
room. The latter habit was but seldom broken by
the presence of friends.</p>

<p class='c004'>A remarkable episode is brought to memory such
as is always found among the homosexuals. He
once fell in love with a girl, an employee’s sweetheart.
That passion soon blew over. Another love
affair, however, almost turned him away from his
customary leaning. There was another girl employed
in the office, a slim, diminutive figure, rather
plain-looking, and underdeveloped (a type resembling
the male). That girl was engaged and her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>young man was in the habit of calling to take her
home. Everybody in the store knew that the young
man was waiting outside at the closing hour (he
claims she was cordial also with some other men in
the store). He fell in love with the girl and soon
showed that uncontrollable passion which is characteristic
of homosexuals when they attempt to save
themselves from man,—when they try to fly from
homosexuality. He soon succeeded in winning her
favor against his rival, who was but a poor employee.
The poor girl was supremely happy and proud that
the wealthy manufacturer’s son had his eye on her.
He promptly showed the girl that his intentions
were honorable. He withdrew entirely from his
father who was bitterly opposed to the affair. He
lived with his thoughts exclusively on and for the
girl. She had to leave the office. The father requested
it and, besides, the other employees gossiped
and spread rumors which were unpleasant to
him. He received anonymous communications
pointing out to him that the girl was flighty. Another
employee told him that he had kissed the girl
and she was not at all a prude. These persons naturally
did not know that their tales only increased
his passion for the girl. For it was precisely the
thought that she had been kissed by another man
that made her so irresistible in his sight. It made
him angry and raging mad but his excitation reacted
upon his homosexual component. The more he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>roused against the girl the more closely he was
enmeshed with her. He met her three times daily. He
called for her in the morning, at noon they took a
walk together, and the evenings, often the nights,
belonged to the girl who proved with a physician’s
certificate that she was still <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">virgo intacta</span></i>. His relations
with her were of such a nature that her virginity
was not endangered. This attitude, this fearsome
withholding from the task of defloration under
the excuse of ethical considerations, is typical of
the neurotic’s feeling of uncertainty and lack of confidence
in himself, fear of binding himself, and fear
of consequences, and shows an insufficient <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">libido</span></i>.
The passion was something rather spiritual, a transference,
something unreal. For they passed some
nights together and he was satisfied merely to be
in the same room (they never slept in one bed).
Her presence had chiefly a quieting effect on him.
Through her he felt himself protected against his
homosexual thoughts. He also needed a love affair
to show the whole world that he was not homosexual
and that he was capable of loving a woman.</p>

<p class='c004'>But during the very first days of this love affair
his jealousy began to assert itself, a peculiarity
characteristic of these subjects, permitting them to
concentrate their mind perpetually on the subject
of men. First he began to investigate her past.
She had to confess everything to him. Then there
followed endless torture over endless days. In the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>morning he began to look questioningly at her. If
she showed blue dark streaks under her eyes, or
looked pale, he felt sure that she had been untrue
to him that night. Although he conducted her home
late at night and called for her early next morning
he still thought that she slipped out of the house
to meet some strange lover somewhere. Often he
stood on watch all night in the front of her home.
He saw curious shadows moving across her window
blind and was sure that it must be a man. He
endured hellish torments over it. He engaged a
detective to watch the girl and caught her in an
innocent lie. His persistent questionings had cowed
her and sometimes she had to lie in order to pacify
him. An innocent fib of that character was the
starting point of a quarrel which kept up for many
weeks. She saw him patrol up and down in front
of her house. He looked badly run down as he did
not sleep nights and he neglected his affairs at the
factory. She made him promise that he would go
home nights. He promised and immediately afterwards
felt uneasy over it. For he was certain that
she made him give that promise so as to be able to
deceive him more easily.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then terrible thoughts of revenge flashed through
his mind. He wanted to shoot the unknown lover
and strangle the girl. Perhaps he sought a proof
of unfaithfulness so as to get rid of the girl and
justify his own disloyalty towards her.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>He naturally pretended once to go on a journey
only to return unexpectedly to the girl. He thought
he smelled cigar smoke, dragged her by the hair,
and wanted to force a confession from her. He also
accused her of intimacy with her 70-year-old
guardian.</p>

<p class='c004'>Such cases are not favorable for analysis and
rather hopeless. I am not as lucky as <em>Bjerre</em><a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a> to
be able to report a complete cure of a case of paranoia.
Usually these patients abandon the psychoanalysis,
finding some pretext to turn from the consultant.
It is useless to explain to them the mechanism
of transference. From the moment when they
perceive a leaning towards their consultant that
sympathetic feeling is changed into anxiety and distrust.
They are unwilling to recognize their homosexuality.
Their psychic disturbance is too deep
and a correction is no longer possible. Often the
subjects stay away after only a few visits. This
sudden abandonment stands in sharp contrast to
their initial enthusiasm for the new method of treatment.
Others stay on with the analysis for a few
weeks but make little or no progress. So long as
their homosexual tendencies are not touched upon,
it is possible to keep up the psychoanalysis a little
longer but the psychoanalysis is superficial under
the circumstances, as they cannot be induced to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>apply candor, always keep secrets from the consultant,
and cover under silence whatever comes into
their mind bearing on their attitude towards their
physician.</p>

<p class='c004'>He carried his revolver whenever he called at my
office, always ready to shoot down the alleged enemy.
I tried to make him understand that he was tortured
by his own homosexual and criminal thoughts.
He listened incredulously but was not so averse as
I have seen most paranoiacs.</p>

<p class='c004'>This patient also stayed away after three weeks
of analysis because the analysis produced in him a
tremendous excitement. He thought I was in league
with his father<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a> to part him from his girl. The
real object of his love was the father who seems to
me to play an important rôle in the psychogenesis
of male paranoia.</p>

<p class='c004'>I saw him two years later during the war. He
had joined the army as volunteer, had made an excellent
record for himself and had been slightly
wounded. Since the war he felt better. He had
given up the engagement shortly after the treatment.
His ideas of persecution had subsided to a
great extent, he claimed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next case shows us a paranoiac jealousy with
insane notions based on proofs ferreted out and
scrutinized with remarkable ingenuity. Such cases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>form the borderline towards the class of querrulants
who clamor always for their “rights,” precisely because
an inner voice clamoring for “injustice” must
be drowned.</p>

<p class='c003'>78. Mr. S. D. is referred to me by his family
physician from a distance. I am asked to determine
whether his jealousy is justified or the result
of a morbid state of mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>He is a very energetic, active 30-year-old merchant,
who conducts the local inn in connection with
his larger business in a small village. In eight years
he made a great success and attained affluence. He
has acquired all the retail business of the place, carries
on also a wholesale business with the neighboring
retail dealers, and was on the way to become a
very wealthy man when he began to quarrel with his
wife on account of his jealousy. His wife was of a
frigid temperament who always remained cool during
his embrace and it always worried him. After
the birth of a couple of children she grew somewhat
more responsive. When she had her first strong
orgasm during his embrace he became suspicious
and concluded at once that she must have had some
other instructor in the art of love. How was it
possible for a cool woman, suddenly, over night,
as it were, to turn into a passionate mate? He began
watching his wife and came to the conclusion
that she must have had intercourse with a certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>man possessing a very long <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">phallus</span></i>. There lived in
that village a farmer who was no longer young, but
wealthy, and known for his long penis and his virility.
That fellow was his regular guest at the
inn. What more natural than that the innkeeper
should conclude that he must be the guilty
man. We note that his mind must have been preoccupied
for a long time with the size of that man’s
penis. That phantasy he projected to his wife.
His curiosity and longing to see that <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">phallus</span></i> he
ascribed to his wife. That is how thought processes
originate. Such <em>autism</em> (<em>Bleuler</em>) renders us uncritical
and permits us to see the whole world
through the subjective coloring of our own emotions.
How could his wife, a woman, fail to be interested
in the size of the peasant’s <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">phallus</span></i>, which was openly
the talk of the tavern, when he, a man, could not
help being interested? Such, approximately, is the
logic of this thinking. He began to watch that
peasant and his wife. He pretended to go on a
journey telling his wife he would not be back before
the following day. But he returned that very evening.
He tiptoed up the steps to the bedroom.
He heard a dull thud. Naturally it was the peasant,
escaping through the window. It was—as the
woman explained—the cat who had been scared off.
He insisted a man had been in the room. His wife
felt so indignant that she wanted to leave him at
once and refused to say another word. He became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>humble and begged her imploringly for forgiveness
telling her the reason for his jealousy. The wife
declared that she had always been passionate but
was ashamed to show it. Finally it came to her all
of a sudden that it was foolish on her part, also, she
had learned to love him more than ever. She cannot
help it if she is now more responsive. There
followed an interval of peace but only for a few
months. Soldiers were quartered in the place and a
physically impressive captain secured a room.
From the moment of his appearance at the place that
captain roused the man’s suspicions. He found
that his wife gave the fellow the best cup of coffee,
that she was altogether too friendly with him,
and that she showered upon him all sorts of pleasant
little courtesies. His wife explained to him that this
captain bought of them all the supplies for his company
and was the means of bringing them important
business, and that she was friendly only for
business reasons, but that their relations had never
trespassed the limits of propriety. But he kept
collecting indications of her unfaithfulness. Among
the proofs he found the butt of a cigarette in his
wife’s room. He questioned her closely and asked
the officer’s orderly to bring him a cigarette from
his master’s case, claiming those cigarettes had such
a pleasant aroma he wanted to try one. He thus
secured a cigarette and found that it bore an identical
mark. The fact was he smoked the same brand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>of cigarettes, but he thought he discovered a certain
stripe which the other cigarettes did not have
(I could not detect the stripe in question). His
other proofs were of a like character. This time
he had a terrible quarrel with his wife,—much more
serious than the previous ordeal. Trouble upon
trouble followed after that. He suspected his clerks
and dismissed them one after another about every
two weeks. Every one was his wife’s lover. Finally
he rushed at his wife, in a fit of anger, to beat her,
and began choking her. The following day the
woman left him, went to live with her sister, and
started proceedings for divorce. She claimed her
husband was not normal and he voluntarily came to
Vienna to place himself under my observation.</p>

<p class='c004'>First I turned my attention to his jealousy and I
tried carefully to correct that. He acknowledged
some points, here and there, showed some insight
into his condition, and was not shocked when I refused
to give him a certificate of good health.
Meanwhile he had removed his beard to give himself
a younger appearance. That change was not
necessary as he was young-looking enough, but it
was part of the outbreak of his feminine tendencies.
He also had a string of dreams in which he was a
woman. Usually he rehearsed the old jealousy
scenes and he repeatedly killed his wife in his
dreams.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus he dreamed:</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span><em>I am with my wife in an old room but dressed as
a woman, so as not to be recognized. My wife steps
out of the room, it was very dark. The captain
comes into the room and wants to touch me under
the dress. But some one calls him out of the room.
I jump at my wife, enraged: that is the kind of a
h—— you are. Now I know everything about you&#160;... and I stick a knife in her throat.</em></p>

<p class='c003'>In another dream he lies hidden under the bed
and feels the swaying motion of coitus above. It
was very characteristic that after quarrels and
scenes of violence he craved intercourse with his wife
and his <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">libido</span></i> was much stronger&#160;... clearly on
account of the sadistic excitation.</p>

<p class='c004'>I saw this patient again five years after the psychoanalysis.
He was divorced from his wife and
was apparently very quiet. He claimed to be entirely
well, said he was jealous no longer, and every
now and then had intercourse with women. I do
not dare decide whether this result may be ascribed
to the analysis and the therapeutic-educational
course of treatment.</p>

<p class='c004'>The various confusion states, called periodic insanity,
must be looked upon as an equivalent of
permanent insanity. It is certainly striking to see
how many alcoholics, morphinists, opium eaters,
cocaine fiends and, in more recent years, victims
addicted to adalin, veronal, medinal, luminal, etc.,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>fear insanity. If such a case is analyzed one always
finds the homosexual component and the repressed
sadistic tendency. The psychic mechanisms
of these disorders are the same as those described
in the paranoid form of the jealousy delusion. We
have in all these cases an endopsychic perception
that inner forces compel greater stress on the delusions
than on reality.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next case is a pure example of this condition
under a form which often ends in suicide.</p>

<p class='c003'>79. Mr. O. L., a very talented violinist, suffers
unbearable anxieties, among them the fear of insanity
being the strongest. He also has hours of
terrific, unexplainable depressions for which he is
unable to give any cause. He only <em>has the feeling
that he is about to commit some terrible deed</em> so as
to rid himself of the anxiety and have peace once
more. He thinks he might commit some crime and
be jailed so as to be sure that there is nothing
further for him to fear. During the first weeks he
speaks only of his anxiety over his father. He has
the idea fixed in his mind that his father will come
to Vienna and have him interned in an insane asylum.
Rather than put up with that <em>he will shoot his
father first and then kill himself</em>. He reverts every
little while to the suspicion that I am in league with
his father. (That is the form which the identification
of the physician with the father assumes with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>this class of patients. The physician is the symbol
of the father.) He has been taking various narcotics
for a number of years. Not, exactly, to sleep.
For he sleeps well without the aid of veronal or
pantopon. But he suffers so much of anxiety. And
he feels that the narcotics make a better man of him.
He uses unbelievable doses of these drugs. He has
once taken with suicidal intent 10 g. veronal in one
dose with the only result that he slept 24 hours
“like a top” and woke up without any ill effects. He
sleeps every day till 11 or noon, sometimes into the
afternoon hours, and still wakes up somewhat
drowsy.</p>

<p class='c004'>He now abstains strictly from alcohol. He has
done a number of foolish things under the influence
of drink. Once he tackled an officer at a night
resort, wanted to embrace him, kiss him, made various
suggestive proposals and finally had to be
thrown out. He has also had serious rows which
put him in the hands of the police. He gave his
word of honor to his father that he would not touch
liquor any more because he was threatened with
internment at a sanitarium for alcoholics. He
broke his word only once but has turned to various
narcotics. During a six-months sojourn at a sanitarium
he got completely well and abandoned the
drugs. One month after leaving the sanitarium he
began again to use the drugs.</p>

<p class='c004'>He is an impressive, handsome, very powerful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>man, very “lucky” with women. But he is true to
none for any length of time excepting the last sweetheart.
He did love her and does to this day. He
would marry her if he could support her.</p>

<p class='c004'>He is tremendously jealous and his jealousy is
that typical form which is concerned with the past,
an example of which we have seen in case 75. He
has to be told over and over by his sweethearts how
they have been seduced. He must hear with particular
circumstantiality all the details of the defloration.
That causes him tremendous sexual excitation.
Only then is he able to achieve orgasm
with women. Otherwise he may keep up the sexual
congress for a half hour without accomplishing
ejaculation.<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>Finally ejaculation and orgasm are brought
about through manual friction of the penis by the
woman. This form of sexual gratification leads back
to a particular incident in his youth when the choice
was made. First, he confesses that at 17 he maintained
relations with a boy who gratified him in
that manner. Earlier reminiscences from childhood
appear. The incidents always relate to boys. Now
he does not want to recognize any homosexual tendencies.
At 17 years he made a forceful attempt
to tear himself away from his friend and began
passionately to run after women and girls.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>His homosexuality shows itself in the choice of
his love objectives. Usually he seduces the sisters
of those of his friends whom he likes in particular.
I know no affair of his in which some man did not
play a rôle. When a man did not figure at the beginning
he was brought in later, so as to complete
the constellation necessary for the rousing of his
libidinous craving. Very characteristic is the following
episode, among the others of the last few
years:</p>

<p class='c004'>He became acquainted at a sanitarium with a
young woman who soon became his sweetheart. One
of his most intimate friends was also at that sanitarium.
He asked his friend to try his luck with
the lady because he wanted to test her faithfulness.
The friend hesitated. He was afraid of a misunderstanding
and the woman was not worth that to
him. Then our subject tried to bring him and his
sweetheart together in another way. He wagered
a large sum of money that he could not get at the
girl. His friend accepted the wager, and three days
later proved that he had won the bet. O. L. wanted
to hear every detail about the seduction and became
so enraged that he could have killed his friend. Then
that friend seduced again another sweetheart of his,
a few months later he attacked him on the street
and would have beaten him up if a few colleagues
had not restrained him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now here in Vienna he is convinced that “that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>d—— fellow” will seduce also his present sweetheart,
a girl whom he truly loves. But if so, he will
find the fellow and kill him as well as the girl. The
woman has a brother who plays an important rôle
in the psychogenesis of this love. Once the woman
told him how devotedly she loved her brother. She
could understand how a sister may give herself to a
brother. Now he urged the woman to give herself
to the brother, setting up but one condition: he
should witness the act. This phantasy assumed
compulsive strength. On every occasion he tortured
her, insisting that she ought to grant him the wish,
and he kept calling in the brother when she did not
want him. Once they were alone. He broke his
word and they drank merrily. He got very drunk
and made a passionate love declaration to his sweetheart’s
brother, begging him to accompany him to
the house and take the sister’s place.</p>

<p class='c004'>His mother died when he was 15 years of age.
The father engaged a young woman to take care of
the house and he fell in love with her. At the same
time he also hated her, fearing that his father would
disinherit him in favor of this woman. He even
planned to put the woman out of the way with poison.
Wholly unconscious and most deeply repressed
is his love for the father, whom he worries and to
whom he causes no end of trouble. He was at the
threshold of a wonderful career, all teachers had
prophesied that he would be some day one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>world’s greatest violinists. His first concert was an
unprecedented success. Then his neurosis broke out
and now he is through with his career. Done with
it and with life.</p>

<p class='c004'>Back of the neurosis the motive of which is to
worry the old father, to irritate him and force him
to pay attention to the unsuccessful son, stands
hidden his passionate love of the father, though he
writes him scolding letters, 20 sheets long, and
threatens to shoot him, should he dare cut down his
rightful inheritance. A certain memory trace leads
to various childhood fancies resembling the affairs
with boys already mentioned. Finally he brings
forth a reminiscence placing his father in an unpleasant
light. The father was also a drinker....</p>

<p class='c004'>It seems as if he had tried to forget that fact.
His fancies of murder are directed against the
father. That becomes clearer all the time. He
turns ill and addicted to veronal so as to commit
no crime. He feels his father slights and neglects
him. They quarrel all the time on account of his
dissipations. The father threatens he will be no
longer responsible for his debts. The son must give
up his expensive habits of living. Then the war
broke out. He was among the first volunteers to
answer the call, distinguished himself several times
with his conduct, and finally met his death in an
engagement.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have already pointed out elsewhere in this work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>the latent homosexuality of drinkers. In the light
of these new considerations, the well-known jealousy
of drinkers reveals an additional feature. The intoxication
is to a certain extent a periodic artificial
paranoia during which the ideas of persecution
come to the foreground. This is very clearly to be
seen in many cases. In that particular respect the
alcohol addict is hardly different from the paranoiac.
Both believe in the objectivity of their insane
notions.</p>

<p class='c004'>The following two case histories of drinkers’
jealousy will conclude this lengthy list of illustrative
cases:</p>

<p class='c003'>80. Mr. N. V., Captain, married at the age of
34 and has been married two years. His marriage
was unhappy from the very first day. Previous to
that he had had intercourse only with <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">puellæ publicæ</span></i>
and with them was always potent. With his
wife he is impotent. He is very unhappy over it
and consoles himself with street women. He began
to drink and beats his wife while intoxicated. He
scolds her, calls her a whore and accuses her of
intimacy with all the officers. Although he had been
drinking formerly, he did so with moderation, but
now he is a confirmed <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">potator</span></i>, spends his time in
dram shops and while intoxicated becomes very
friendly with the waiters and other underlings, kissing
them and toasting their comradeship. He is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>firmly convinced that his wife is unfaithful to him
and even suspects his boy whom he beats mercilessly
when under the influence of drink.</p>

<p class='c004'>The woman left her husband and fled to her
parents.</p>

<p class='c004'>That affected the man so depressingly that, after
a three months’ stay at a sanitarium, he returned
penitently, a changed man, and prevailed upon the
wife to return and live with him again. But in a
few weeks his old demoniac jealousy set in once
more. This time he accused her of the most horrible
crimes. He reproached her that she allowed
herself to be licked by the dog and shot the animal.
He watched her carefully and denied her the least
social intercourse. Finally he accused her of intimacy
with her 15-year-old brother. He found a
small spot on the bed linen and he cut that out to
preserve as proof of her infidelity. He pounced on
her one night, choked her, and tried to force her to
confess her doings with the brother. Again she fled
to her parents but hesitated to turn her husband
over to the lunacy board. She did not want to be
the cause of his commitment to a sanitarium.</p>

<p class='c004'>Meanwhile the patient’s insanity grew rapidly.
He drank to great excess and raised a big row in
front of her parents’ home. He complained to the
police that his wife and her younger brother, with
whom she maintains criminal relations, had set a
number of desperate-looking characters on his trail.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>He served notice that he would give those fellows
something to remember him by and that the first one
who would dare come too close to him would be shot
down. Commitment. Delirium tremens. Exitus in
consequence of an intercurrent malady.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is noteworthy that the suspected little brother-in-law
had been a great favorite of his; he had been
fond of taking the boy along on his hunting trips.
When completely under the influence of drink he
always wanted to embrace him and pet him.</p>

<p class='c004'>A connection between paranoia and alcoholism is
shown also by the last of this series of observations,
which follows:</p>

<p class='c003'>81. This is a woman no longer in her prime of
life. She is the grandmother of several children,
54 years of age, and, up to a few years ago, she was
not jealous. As soon as her husband ceased to have
intercourse with her she was seized with the idea that
he must have intercourse with a certain pretty girl
who had been formerly in their employ and had left.
She had seen that girl often in the neighborhood and
wondered that the girl looked so well and was so well
dressed. She had always liked the girl very much.
In fact, she wept when the girl left the house. Now
she tortured her husband with the accusation that
he was intimate with that girl,—she was sure of it.
The man denied it, but—grilled by her—he had to
admit that he had met the girl on the street a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>times and had spoken to her. That led to such terrible
quarrels,—he had to leave the house and was
gone for weeks on a journey. He wanted to have
peace and was energetic enough to bring it about.
In fact, he threatened to sue for separation.</p>

<p class='c004'>The woman began to drink, specially liqueurs, but
also ordinary whiskey. When intoxicated she behaved
very vulgarly and cursed the girl; called her
a whore, and shouted that she ought to have the
clothes torn off her. She threatened her youngest
daughter’s husband and entertained the notion of
throwing acid at him. While intoxicated she also
felt an impulse to seek out her youngest daughter
(obviously to find her son-in-law) and ran to the
railroad station, entered the wrong train, and committed
all sorts of nuisances so that she had to be
committed. At the asylum she had to give up drink
but showed no ill effects from the enforced abstinence,
only she figured daily what her husband was
up to with the girl. Like most paranoiacs she
claimed that she had telepathic powers and felt at a
distance that her husband was with the girl. That
was an absolute fact and no physician could convince
her it was not so.</p>

<p class='c004'>That contention embodied an inner truth: the
man in her was with the girl, that is, the man in her
was continually preoccupied with the girl. In fact,
she had no other thought than the girl. It was as
if she was saying to herself: <em>If I were a man I would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>fall in love with this girl and would not leave her
alone a minute. She would have to be mine only.</em></p>

<p class='c004'>After the marriage of her youngest daughter she
fell into a depression during which she first began
the habit of indulging in alcoholic drinks.</p>

<p class='c004'>Obviously the woman had two homosexual objectives
which she fused: the servant girl and the
youngest daughter. In fact, she began early to
think that her husband was intimate with the daughter
in question. She even lodged with the authorities
a complaint to that effect and asked to be
allowed to bring proofs of the assertion. Now her
husband wanted to poison her. She had been given
coffee which had an arsenical smell.</p>

<p class='c004'>She transfers to the surroundings her subjective
criminal ideas. We see that she had to drink in
order to deafen in her the wild beast which endeavored
to break forth in all its primordial crudity.
Her commitment to an asylum did not change her
leanings. She swore at her man who conspired with
the hateful son-in-law to have her put out of the
way so as to prevent her from exposing their evil
doings before the whole world.</p>

<p class='c004'>How close the forbidden tendencies are to one
another in such cases! Almost uniformly the same
picture throughout: criminality, homosexuality and
incest. After years of the compulsory yoke of a
formal monosexuality the repression gives way and
the underlying pansexuality and criminal tendencies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>manifest themselves in pathologic form. For all
these case histories center around the “other,” the
second, self,—the repressed component of human
nature.</p>

<p class='c004'><em>We know</em> many persons who prove themselves victims
of our monosexual culture. The race is paying
for the development of monosexuality with neurotic
homosexuality, with all the various neuroses, with
alcoholism and paranoia!</p>

<p class='c004'>But it would be erroneous for that reason to decry
the course of cultural development or to look for the
improvement of conditions to changes in law or in
the formal code of morals. All lovers of mankind
surely must fight for the abandonment of the moral
opprobrium and legal persecution of homosexuals and
for a greater freedom from bias in the perception
of the problem of all paraphilias. But we must not
fail to recognize that we are dealing here with tremendous
social forces and with developmental tendencies
striving, beyond all human range, for the
attainment of unknown higher ideals. <em>The development
of the race is from bisexualism to monosexualism.
Even the “genuine” homosexuality as we know
it today everywhere is a proof in favor of this contention.</em></p>

<p class='c004'>For if homosexuality were an inborn trait, as
<em>Hirschfeld</em> and his pupils maintain, it would be the
pattern-type of health and homosexuals would show
no repressed heterosexuality; there would be no morphinists,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>no drinkers, and no dipsomaniacs<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c012'><sup>[22]</sup></a> among
them. Their number may not be large, but that is
because the uranists’ homosexuality is already a
compromise, an attempt on the part of nature, and
of the psyche, to escape the insolvable bisexual conflict.
The very fact that all neurotics represent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>retrogressions shows that the race is advancing
towards monosexuality. The neurotic, as a bisexual
being, might stand for an earlier developmental
phase, if the cultural standards of morality would
not hinder. When he attempts it (like, for instance,
<em>Oscar Wilde</em>) he draws upon himself the deadly
scorn of his fellowmen; he is ostracized as a citizen.
Homosexuality leads but seldom to paranoia when
associated with heterosexuality, as happens in the
reverse instance,—heterosexuals trying to repress
their homosexuality. That in itself shows homosexuality
to be a neurosis,—the premonitory phase
of the paranoiac psychosis. When paranoia breaks
out, the homosexual holds to the delusion that he
belongs to the opposite sex and may go so far as
to disregard his genitalia and to acquire the feeling
that he is physically changed. The paranoia attempts
to round out physically the delusion of sexual
transformation it has initiated psychically. The
wish of the male homosexual: “I want to be a
woman!” is fulfilled in paranoia. In that state he
finds a thousand proofs that he is a woman. Many
such cases have been described especially by <em>Krafft-Ebing</em>,
who has called them “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">metamorphosis sexualis
paranoica</span></i>.” The subjects imagine that they have
the monthly flow because they have the nose-bleed
every four weeks (this happens also with nonparanoia
<em>urnings</em>),—they have a flow from the lower
parts for five days at every full moon. A patient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>of <em>Krafft-Ebing’s</em> relates (Obs. 134, p. 245):
“Every four weeks at the full moon I have for 5 days
the <em>molimina</em>, like any woman, physically and mentally,
only I do not flow,—but I have a sensation of
discharging fluid, a feeling of fulness about the
genitals and the lower part of the body (within);
a very pleasant time it is, especially later (in a
couple of days) when the physiologic craving for
procreation looms forth with its all-pervading
womanly force.” Another paranoiac claims that
he has always been woman, but when he was a child
a French magician had miraculously endowed him
with male organs and, with a certain salve, hindered
the development of his breasts. A girl under my
observation felt her penis, pointed to the hairs on
her face, and thought she was a bewitched male.
But she could feel her penis growing within and
almost coming through.</p>

<p class='c004'>The following statement by the highest expert on
homosexuality shows that the repression of heterosexuality
may have serious effects upon the homosexual,—it
may drive him to drink, or into a delusion
of persecution:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have seen, in the homosexual, states of precordial
anxiety with strong vasomotor excitation as
serious as such conditions could be. Next to
anxiety neurosis, an occasional consequence of abstinence
seems to me to be the occurrence of a sort of
persecution mania which is rather difficult to determine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>whether it belongs to the compulsive neuroses
or is actually a part of the picture of paranoia.
Such persons imagine everybody suspects their
homosexuality; they look at their hands and laugh
sheepishly because they wear no engagement or
marriage ring; at restaurants persons sitting at
neighboring tables whisper and knowingly nod
among themselves as they talk about the ‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">eingefleischten
Junggesellen</span></i>’; porters and waiters at
hotels ‘catch on’ to ‘what is up’ and treat them
either more or less attentively than other customers;
passers-by on the street comment on their tripping
gait; in short, they feel that they are watched
everywhere and are uncomfortably self-conscious;
some blush continually, others become morbidly suspicious
and timid, others again—and that is the
worst—take to drink. Convinced of the truthfulness
of their notions and refractory in their attitude
towards the physician, patients of this type make up
their minds late and only after considerable struggle,
to consult a physician and even then they often do
it under an assumed name. If the ideas of persecution
have already persisted for a long time, the
condition is hardly one that can be influenced by
treatment,—in any case it requires the greatest skill
and patience on the part of the physician as well as
his whole therapeutic armamentarium, of which
psychotherapy and hydrotherapy are most important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>means, while drugs, rather excessively favored
nowadays, should be used but sparingly.” (<em>Hirschfeld,
loc. cit.</em>, p. 455.)</p>

<p class='c004'>This observation of <em>Hirschfeld’s</em> discloses the
homosexual’s deep feeling of self-reproach which
must be ascribed to hidden criminality rather than
to the homosexuality. Perhaps that fusion of homosexuality
with criminality, of pathologic self-love
and repressed hatred, that incapacity for true love,
is the reason why men struggle against monosexuality
and why innumerable victims fall in that
struggle, their refined souls crushed by the conflict.
Just as we no longer have the gods of antiquity—men
with female bosoms and women with a tremendous
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">phallus</span></i>—just as we have accepted the division
of God into three components (man, woman, and
child) which unitedly represent but one force, so we
must choose, in our day, our ideal. <em>That is the
monotheism of sexuality,—more unyielding and
strict than religious monotheism. “To love means
to find one’s God,” I stated. But there must be no
other gods besides that one. This struggle for the
single god of love sums up the erotic tragedies of
our cultural development: the struggle for the true
ideal and for monogamy which for the present appears
the utmost sexual ideal of our current cultural
level. Between the primitive man’s pansexualism
and the monosexuality of modern man may be found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>all the developmental phases and inhibitions which
manifest themselves as neuroses, paraphilias, drunkenness,
psychoses, etc.</em></p>

<p class='c004'>The analysis of jealousy has shown us clearly
that with the outbreak of the repressed homosexuality
criminality, too, comes to the surface. The
patients whose histories we have recorded, fight,
carry revolvers and threaten murder. Many a
jealousy murder is due to the instinctive asocial
cravings. We must bear in mind that the repression
keeps down the homosexuality as well as
the other paraphiliac instincts, including the criminal
tendencies. When the repressed homosexuality
breaks through the protecting covers and out of
the unconscious, it carries along and brings to surface
all the repressed antagonistic cravings. This
mental mechanism explains the gruesome crimes
which the paranoiacs commit who believe themselves
pursued or threatened. They project to their surroundings
not only the pursuit with homosexual
intent but their subjective criminal tendencies as
well. Someone is after them to kill them&#160;... it
really means: “<em>I want to kill and therefore I assume,
that others want to kill me.</em>”</p>

<p class='c004'>Looking upon homosexuality as an archaic symptom,
a regressive manifestation, we may understand
also that the incest, in all its forms, must play a
greater rôle among homosexuals than among the
normals. The <em>urning</em>, in point of psychic progression,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>is nearer the ancient <em>Œdipus</em> and the <em>urlind</em>
is nearer ancient <em>Elektra</em> than the normal man.
Their will to power also manifests itself through
stronger tendencies. The very repression of his
heterosexual component shows that the homosexual
tries to achieve mastery over self, and is a proof
of the one-sided emphasis of his stubborn will to
self-control. The will to power breaks out in violent,
affectively stressed jealousy deeds, which
shows the intimate inner relations between homosexuality
and sadism,—a subject to which we shall
give more careful consideration in our next chapter.</p>

<p class='c003'>Our investigation of the problem of jealousy has
led us repeatedly to the relationship between homosexuality
and sadism, a subject we have already
considered briefly in connection with the repression-symptoms
of the homosexuals. We have succeeded
in proving the sadistic trend of homosexuals in most
of the cases which we have examined. This relationship
is so typical that I am surprised previous
investigators have not been impressed by the regularity
of its occurrence. The frequency of abnormal
sexual cravings among homosexuals has been
pointed out by many physicians and has been interpreted
by them as indicative of a degenerative trend.
But since the physicians were satisfied with their
patients’ account and they were unfamiliar with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>technique of psychoanalysis, this constant relationship
escaped their observation. The next chapter
will be devoted to a complete history of such cases
and in that connection we shall see more clearly how
unsatisfactory the patients’ first account of their
own trouble must be. I have already mentioned
that many investigators suspect that the homosexuals
decidedly lack veracity. Moreover all neurotics
drive their sadistic tendencies back into the
unconscious. Their repressed tendencies are among
the persistently overlooked features,—the unconsidered
inventory,—of the homosexual’s psyche.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sadistic tendency breaks to the foreground
of consciousness only occasionally and then it lends
its characteristic coloring to the paraphilic disorder.
In such cases the sadistic trend is not
directed only against the opposite sex. Sexual lust
and cruelty are inextricably interwoven; the antisocial
cravings cannot be sublimated;<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a> the ailing
individual becomes a danger to the community, he
gets into conflict with the law, and lands in jail or
in the asylum. For such cases show us a morbidly
enlarged and distorted picture of the average homosexual.</p>

<p class='c004'>The following observation by <em>Fleischmann</em><a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a> may
serve as an illustration of this fact:</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>82. “Physically the patient shows the early
signs of <em>Basedow’s</em> disease. His temperament is
very uneven, he shifts from one extreme to another.
He is suspicious, very mendacious and very irritable—for
instance, he struck his father in his rage.
He is not particularly religious. His whole conduct
shows a very weak will and lack of energy.
Since his 17th year the patient has been addicted
to excessive drink. His sexual history reveals the
following facts: As a boy, 10 years of age, he came
across a book containing an illustration of a scene
of violence (beating) which gave him great pleasure.
Ever since he thinks of that picture placing
himself in the position of the one being beaten.
The mere word ‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Peitschen</span></i>,’ cuffing, has something
appealing, something exciting about it to his mind.
From the very beginning the patient thought this
was an unhealthy trait and was uncomfortably self-conscious
over it. At that time he took a journey
into the country with his mother. They passed
over a river and he saw standing on the shore a
naked man who was bathing. That scene stuck in
his mind for months. At 11 years of age the patient
asked his father to punish him because he had
an impure conscience, but did not attain his aim.
His fancies were growing. He liked to put himself
in Captain Dreyfus’ place, wanted to experience
the latter’s degradation and suffering. So constantly
was his mind preoccupied with his fancies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>that the boy neglected his school studies; he became
distraught, and suffered headaches. At 15
years of age the boy began to enact his phantasies;
he undressed in a room, tied his hands with a rope
and suspended himself. He also tied weights to his
lower limbs. This produced orgasm and ejaculation.
An illustration of tortures which he found in
an illustrated work on world history suggested to
him new methods. He was specially fond of staging
scenes of crucifixion. In all these scenes the boy
fancied that he was the victim of all the imaginary
tortures. He never connected these fancies of torture
with one sex or the other. He had sexual
gratification without reflecting particularly about
sex. The gratifications led to orgasm and ejaculation.
Then the craving for self-torture quieted
down somewhat, his imagination cooled off and the
patient began to seek sexual gratification through
masturbation. He drew his penis downwards and
backwards between his limbs and rocked his pelvis
sideways. During these acts there arose the first
homosexual fancies. While masturbating, which he
did at first regularly once every four weeks, later
daily and afterwards, five to ten times in succession,<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c012'><sup>[25]</sup></a>
he pictured to himself the hips of a young boy. At
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>first that fancy, without any further details, was
enough. Later he fancied carrying out <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">coitus intra
femora</span></i>. His contrary sexual feelings showed themselves
also in other ways. For instance, he took
such a strong fancy to a younger comrade that he
resolved to stay voluntarily back one year so as to
sit in the same classroom with that boy. On account
of his lack of veracity his father put him in
a training institution; there his comrades initiated
him into sex matters and he learned mutual masturbation.
He was not aware of being untruthful
because he had lost the faculty of discerning between
phantasy and fact. At 17 years of age the
patient picked up a peasant girl and induced her
to sleep with him; but she did not allow coitus; the
patient thinks that at that time he would have
found coitus pleasurable.<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c012'><sup>[26]</sup></a> During that period he
was in the habit of abusing daily one of his best
friends,—in his phantasy. He had the latter stand
naked before his eyes and played with his private
parts. In his phantasy he felt all over the fellow’s
body, finally advancing to a complete homosexual
act, always fancying a one-sided active <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">immissio
penis in anum</span></i>; at the same time he masturbated in
the manner described above. After one year he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>no longer able to control himself. He prevailed on
his friend to undress before him and lie, face down,
on the sofa. Then the patient crawled on top and
attempted <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">immissio</span></i>; he did not succeed on account
of a sudden feeling of nausea. He desisted, but
ejaculated <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante portas</span></i>; afterwards he was ashamed
of it. The patient parted from this friend later as
the result of a quarrel. Then the sadistic tendencies
again came to surface. He imagined all sorts
of tortures, reserving to himself merely the rôle of
devising the punishment to be applied. The actual
carrying out of the deeds he left to other imaginary
persons conjured up for the purpose. He chose his
victims preferably from among his younger comrades.
Patient had devised 36 different kinds of
torture assigning to each a written symbol. He
selected by lot (drawing numbers) the intended
victim, as well as the torture to be applied and the
instruments therefor. The patient played this game
for hours.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He kept this up a couple of years. Suddenly the
whole thing lost its charm for him. His phantasy
cooled down. Finally he gave up the game altogether.
At 18, the patient attempted for the second
time normal coitus. He had an erection but
premature ejaculation <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante portas</span></i>. A third attempt
failed on account of drunkenness. Again he
reverted to his masturbation habit, his thoughts
during the act once more centered on the hips of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>young boy; this was a fetich to him. Masochistic
fancies he entertained no longer; but he dwelt profusely
on homosexual phantasies. Later the patient
thought of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">coitus inter femora</span></i> with boys. He became
very friendly with a 14-year-old boy, kissed
him, and allowed the boy to touch his own genitals.
But when he found that the boy had hairy hips his
passion for the boy cooled off at once. During that
time the patient (20 years old) entertained thoughts
of suicide because he felt that his life was a failure.
An attempt at analysis only excited him
worse instead of quieting him. Again the patient
linked himself in intimate friendship with a 14-year-old
boy; as that boy resented any physical display
of affection, his attachment remained purely platonic.
Every now and then patient masturbated
fancying he was carrying out <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">coitus inter femora</span></i>
with his friend. His sadistic fancies again broke
to the surface. He became more and more restless,
enticed a boy (under a slight pretext) to visit him
and devised most refined ways of abusing him; for
instance, hanging over the boy’s back with the hands
clasped around his neck, or beating him over hips
and buttocks with a reed cane; for every stroke the
boy was to receive a sum of money. As a consequence
of this action the patient was brought to
the clinic.”<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c012'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span><em>Fleischmann</em>, in his psychologic examination of
this case, lays stress particularly on the significance
of trauma and ascribes to the masturbation a predominant
rôle in the psychogenesis of the paraphilia:
“This case proves clearly that the various
sexual anomalies differ only in their sexual objective
and aim,—their developmental interrelationship—but
that the mechanism of their development must
be looked upon as identical.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But of particular significance in this case is the
constant association of sadism and masochism, a
condition with which but few sexologists thus far
have been impressed as a bipolar expression of the
same underlying tendency; next, the tremendous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>sense of guilt which no masochist lacks; further,
the defense reaction against the homosexual tendencies:
disgust of the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">immissio penis in anum</span></i>, and
the unpleasant feelings roused by the sight of the
boy’s hairy thighs.</p>

<p class='c004'>This patient also illustrates the overwhelming
rôle of the father in the psychogenesis of homosexuality
and the recurrence of the “specific scene.”
At 11 years of age he requested his father to beat
him because he felt guilty. At 25 years he carried
out that very act on a boy under a very refined
form. One must be a victim of psychic blindness
not to see that he there played the rôle of the
father who punishes the child. The development of
this attitude may be surmised to have taken place
approximately as follows: His primary phantasy
was undoubtedly generated by the wish that his
father be tender with him. He wanted to replace
the mother in his father’s affection (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">coitus inter
femora</span></i>). Probably jealousy thoughts against the
mother, revenge fancies against the father on account
of unrequited love; these mental sins gave rise
to his feeling of guilt, as displayed in his masochism.
For as I shall prove in another work<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c012'><sup>[28]</sup></a> in this Series,
sadism is always the primary attitude and is transposed
into masochism in consequence of the feeling
of guilt, or else the two appear side by side.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>I must comment on <em>Fleischmann’s</em> remark that
psychoanalysis only disturbed the patient and did
not cure him. It is not proper to ascribe all failures
of psychoanalysis to the method. Psychoanalysis
is a difficult art and will always be conducted
expertly only by a relatively small number
of specialists. Not everything that goes under the
name of psychoanalysis is genuine. Often the patient
submits for a few days to psychoanalysis then
drops it (when a successful psychoanalysis may require
several months) and claims it did him no
good.<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c012'><sup>[29]</sup></a> A thorough psychoanalysis of the above
case would have certainly led to a deeper understanding
of the mental mechanism involved and
would have revealed much new light.</p>

<p class='c004'>Undoubtedly various sexual repressed tendencies
may become manifest during psychoanalytic treatment.
That is even necessary,—they must be met
and overcome with the consultant’s aid. The next
case below is an illustration that latent homosexuality
may become manifest after a few seances in
the course of psychoanalysis.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>83. Mr. Delta, medical student, 24 years of age,
hereditary history negative, physically healthy in
every respect, suffers of depressions and inability
to concentrate on his work. The most important
facts bearing on his anamnesis and his later history
he relates in the following letter:</p>

<p class='c003'>“From my earliest childhood I have been extraordinarily
sensuous. It was the custom (an evil
one) in our family for the children to crawl into
the parents’ bed in the morning. I naturally always
went to mother’s bed, while my sisters preferred
to go to father’s bed. We children also went
to one another’s bed and on such occasions I was
in the habit of trying to crawl with my head under
the covers with the intention, frankly, of carrying
out <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cunnilingus</span></i> especially on my sister N., who was
already married. Why I preferred N., at the time
I do not understand clearly, possibly because she
was receptive towards me and such practices are
possible only if the female partner is at least unconsciously
agreeable to it. I was 5 years of age at
the time. I have also carried on <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cunnilingus</span></i> on my
sister B., at 15 years of age, while she was asleep.
These fancies later played a tremendous rôle in my
mental life, causing also a profuse sweating of the
palms of my hands which disappeared in part when
I became consciously aware of them. The killing
of the chickens by our cook produced an extraordinarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>exciting effect upon me. When the cook
gripped the chicken between her limbs near her
genital region to kill it she excited me to the point
of a true orgasm. I tried to imitate her by catching
flies and squeezing them to death between my
limbs, near my genitals, or by drowning them in
urine. My attitude towards friends, colleagues, etc.,
was also extremely peculiar. I cultivated preferably
the friendship of children of the proletarian
class, while children of my own set never attracted
me in particular, although I was friendly with them.
Children of that class also submitted more willingly
to various homosexual acts, something which I did
not quite dare carry on with children of my own set.
I remember one boy in particular, with whom I
attempted <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">coitus in os</span></i>. I recall also a dream of my
childhood years: An awful butchery is going on in
our court yard and my sister W., and a certain man
are in it. I am pursued by both, they throw me
on the ground, and I am killed with a single blow
on the forehead. I may add that killing invoked in
my mind the picture of the aggressor sitting astride
over the victim’s face and mouth, rider-fashion.
That at any rate was the manner in which we boys
killed one another. Girls of my age were a torture
to me but to older girls and adult women I extended
my greatest admiration,—a sentiment which was
purely platonic with me at the time. At the public
school I fell in love with every strict teacher, once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>I was in love with two of them at the same time. I
wanted the two to punish me and that, in a very
strange way. I wanted to be taken to bed and to
be squeezed to death by them,<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c012'><sup>[30]</sup></a>—naturally between
their genitalia. The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">immictio in os</span></i> by a woman was
also a favorite form of torture in my day dreaming.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now comes puberty. I consider the starting
point of my later neurosis the fact that I cared for
contact only with persons who could offer me some
sexual satisfaction and that even as a child. During
puberty this peculiarity showed even more
markedly. For a time I preserved my platonic admiration
of women older than myself. Young girls
were still repulsive to me until I fell passionately in
love with one. I followed that little one for years
like a shadow, but in spite of the encouragement she
gave me I could not bring myself to speak to her.
When I finally did so, I saw in a flash the reason for
my remarkable hesitation, I did not say what I
started to say, the whole charm was gone in an instant,—she
seemed to me common and inferior,—although
my objective judgment at other times told
me precisely the reverse. In short, my affection reawakened
in its earlier intensity only some time after
I recovered from the shock of my personal acquaintance
with her. At that time I became very friendly
with a certain colleague, Joseph Z. The tie that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>linked us was that very bewitching dark girl. He
also was in love with her (one would have thought
that this would have broken our friendship). We
never tired admiring her charms between us and
our friendship came to an end only when I discovered
that he was not true to our idol. At the
same time nothing disgusted me during that period
so much as the sight of a pair of lovers. <em>I had the
feeling that a man loses something of his manliness
and dignity through intimacy with a woman.</em></p>

<p class='c004'>“My next friend was Herbert. I had few sexual
points of contact with him, except that we visited
together the red light resorts for the first time and
jointly made love to the various inmates. Herbert
was so witty a fellow that I almost loved him, especially
as he was slavishly devoted to me. But my
neurosis made tremendous leaps for the worse even
at that time and I became more and more timid and
awkward in my ways and when finally he turned on
me with his wit our friendship came to an end.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Next came Friedrich. He clung to me with fanatic
love, this went on for about three years, until
he married, and then I felt lonely in the world.
My beloved mother to whom I was extremely devoted
as a child could only try to console me, but I
was hopelessly disconsolate. As a child I had been
inseparable from her for years; <em>Mendelssohn’s</em> well-known
Spring song brought tears to my eyes because
the thought of a mother losing her child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>seemed atrocious to me. Although I felt a great
measure of that affection for mother which is common
in every one’s childhood experience, a certain
craving remained ungratified. I became acquainted
with psychoanalysis and it brought to my mind the
youthful perversities of my youth. I decided to
give expression to my conscious instincts and I have
come to the following conclusion:</p>

<p class='c004'>“<em>My attitude towards the other sex will never be
satisfactory, I must stand either above or below
woman, must be either hammer or anvil, an unprejudiced
relationship I find impossible, because as
soon as I see a pretty woman I lose my senses, and
would like preferably to be at her feet and obey her
like a slave. But women do not wish that, they want
to be submissive themselves, they want to feel the
man above them.</em> Intercourse on the level of
equality I find tiresome, so there remains only sadism
for me, through which, I may confess frankly,
I have already enjoyed pleasant times. True friendship
on the basis of mutual love and respect I am
capable of maintaining only with men, as in my
childhood.”</p>

<p class='c003'>This sounds like the history of a typical bisexual
strongly on the way to become a genuine homosexual.
Let us turn to his psychoanalytic treatment
before we examine his sexual attitude. He went to
a psychoanalyst who had been recommended to him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>by <em>Freud</em>. He was wholly unable to work, impotent
with women at the time, and had recourse to masturbation.
During the first sitting he learned that
he had been in love with his mother. The knowledge
of this fact acted as a “relief,” according to his testimony.
(He even told it to his mother.) Shortly
afterwards he had his first successful coitus with a
woman. But the neurosis did not change and in a
short time he came to me for analysis. I found a
tremendous resistance against the discovery of the
true attitude. He employed all sorts of subterfuges
to take up the time during the consultation hours
and to disclose only what he wanted. He soon exhausted
the account of his pronounced sadism and
of his masochistic tendencies. But concerning his
relations to his father he was very hazy. He became
able to go to work, attended the lectures and
turned once more diligently to his studies. I saw
the hopelessness of my endeavors and broke the
analysis under some pretext or other.... There
are patients, whom I have described as the psychoanalytic
<em>Ahasverus-type</em><a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c012'><sup>[31]</sup></a> who are among the most
thankless of subjects for our professional endeavors.
They rush from one analyst to another,
imploring the new consultant to remove the last of
their troublous symptoms, and stay all the time
very much as they have been from the beginning.
They look upon the analysis, too, as a test of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>power, they want to triumph over their consultant,
they want to come out stronger than he and—what
is most important—they do not want to recognize
the real background of their attitude. They stubbornly
overlook the real foundation of their neurotic
trouble and their ‘unwillingness to see’ is made
worse by their superficial acquaintance with psychoanalysis
and their fragmentary introspection.
They thus run from one physician to another, criticize
the first to the second, the second to a third,
the third to a fourth. This conduct stands partly
in relation to their attitude towards the father,—a
subject to which we shall have occasion to revert
more fully later.</p>

<p class='c004'>It happened precisely as I had surmised. He
went back to <em>Freud</em>, who recommended a third
analyst, because he refused stubbornly to return to
the first. After a few months he gave up the treatment
and considered himself well. One half year
later he came back to me and told me that since
adopting exclusively homosexual relations he was
entirely well, able to work, and as lively “as a fish
in the brook.” But something still seemed to be
lacking. At my request he wrote the account which
I have given above, stating that he had no objection
to its publication. He added orally a few
statements which I shall use later.</p>

<p class='c004'>The characteristic feature of his attitude towards
woman is emphasized in his own written statement.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>Either he must torture or he must be tortured—he
can either love or must hate, and only to excess.
He is afraid of his terrific love passion. Therefore
he feels impelled to humble himself before woman, to
serve her as a slave, which is his symbolic expression
for the longing after <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cunnilingus</span></i> and for his willingness
to submit to <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mictio in os</span></i>. He wants to serve
woman as a means for the attainment of gratification,
as a vessel for her excreta, to be a submissive
slave to all her whims. His submissiveness goes so
far that he is willing to be killed by woman. This
sadistic transposition of this attitude signifies:
only through doing away with the sexual partner
one achieves complete mastery and may claim complete
possession.</p>

<p class='c004'>In his feeling-attitude towards woman he vacillates
between two extremes: hatred to the point of
annihilation and a love so great as to include the
willingness to be sacrificed. Clearly, he must protect
himself so as not to give way to his hatred
and become a murderer. A deeper insight into the
parallelogram of the psychic forces involved in such
situations leads plainly to the conviction that the
instinct to live and the will to power prevent him
from subjecting himself to woman actually to the
point of self-annihilation. His feeling-attitude towards
woman is too affective for him to be able
to reduce it to a proper emotional level. How
plain is the significance of his boyhood experience,—his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>great passion for the girl whom he followed
like a shadow. But he did not dare to bring that
love affair down to reality. He was afraid of himself,
afraid of the subjection. The girl gave him
to understand that he need not belittle himself at
all. In his eyes that was enough for her to lose her
charm after he became acquainted with her; she
attracted him again only after all danger of his
trying himself out with her was over. He considered
himself plain-looking and thought he could
not attract any one. He hated the women on account
of their charm, because he himself would have
liked to have been a pretty woman.</p>

<p class='c004'>He also cleverly covered that wish by beginning
to overstress the value of manliness. “I had a feeling,”
he states, “that a man loses something of his
manliness and dignity through his intimacy with a
female person.” One must bear in mind that this
man esteemed his mother very highly, holding her
above all others as a person and as a woman. The
normal person forms the image of his ideal woman
after his mother. But he looks upon his mother as
an exception and, like many other homosexuals, excepts
his mother alone from the scorn with which
he looks down upon the whole female sex. Now he
tolerates woman but only with a sadistic feeling-attitude.
For hatred vanquishes woman easier than
love.</p>

<p class='c004'>The question, what is he seeking in man and why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>does he prefer men to women?, he answers as
follows: “I seek the penis in man. I think chiefly
of his penis. With men I find no resistance at all.
Woman I consider ugly while man is beautiful. I
look chiefly for womanly men who to me stand for
the girl with the penis. <em>I was attracted only once
to an elderly man with a very energetic face.</em> And
what particularly attracts me to man: there is no
question of any submissiveness with him. Man does
not humble himself,—only woman does that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But he does not seek the submissive woman. He
needs a strong woman who shall domineer over him.
He confesses that intercourse with a woman sadist
would gratify him. But, as he states in his written
account: women do not care to domineer, they want
to be overpowered themselves.</p>

<p class='c004'>We note that the polar sexual tension between
male and female is most extreme in his case. He
could kill the woman who humiliates him, belittles
him, as Judith killed Holofernes, because he had
conquered her sexually.<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c012'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>His peculiar manner of masturbating (squeezing
flies to death against the penis) discloses his specific
onanistic fancy. He squeezes a woman to death,
he strangles her, while cohabiting with her. A short
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>time after the first analysis he had sexual intercourse
with a servant girl. He described her to
me: “a gigantic girl, and so powerful that she could
have overpowered me with one hand!” With such
a girl he felt safe. But he never dared to have
sexual intercourse with weak persons, even though
they exerted a stronger sexual attraction on him.
He had every reason to flee from woman, because
he feared the transposition of his excessive love
passion into a deadly aggressive hatred. He claims
he could have intercourse now only with a woman
addicted to all sorts of perversities. Only such a
woman could rouse his passion and could offer him
something. He has never tried this out. It looks
as if he feared the involvement of his heart, but that
could use woman merely as a vehicle for his lust.
A perverse woman would drown the urgings of his
strongest paraphilia: the impulse to kill a woman.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now we may understand through his family history
how this attitude must have arisen.</p>

<p class='c004'>He belonged to a family where both parents had
very pronounced individualities of their own. The
father was a self-made man, who rose through his
own efforts and became a millionaire. He was
strict, energetic, always preoccupied with his business,
and never had any spare time for his family.
With the children he was tender while they were
small and pretty playthings. Later he changed
completely his attitude and the patient was required
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>and expected to show a good record of his
conduct at school. He continued to be tender with
the girls, so that the boy must have unconsciously
envied his sisters. This change from tenderness to
severity on the part of parents is very common and
is responsible for many instances of stubborn contrariness
on the part of children, especially towards
the father. The child always longs for the
early childhood when the father was so loving and
tender. Perhaps this longing for early childhood
is the reason why so many homosexuals are of a
decidedly infantile type.<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c012'><sup>[33]</sup></a> The kindly old gentleman
sought by so many homosexuals is perhaps
merely the affectionate father of their youth, who
never punished severely....</p>

<p class='c004'>Our patient’s mother was a remarkably intelligent
and very beautiful woman, who all her life
contended with her husband for rulership over the
house. I had an opportunity to obtain a deep insight
into that marriage situation. I know of no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>other marriage where the struggle for supremacy
was so bitter between the two personalities. There
were constantly quarrels in the house, often on the
point of breaking out in violence. Each one avoided
showing any affection for the other. To do so
would have meant acknowledging the other’s superiority.
They did everything they could to each
other. They bore themselves with aloofness and
appeared indifferent towards one another, though
keeping up a continuous quarrel. If the husband
noticed some other man courting his handsome wife,
he smiled indulgently and accorded his rival a free
field, as if to prove to his wife that he was not jealous
in the least, and was willing to accord her every
freedom. She also seemed to overlook the seamy
side, in her husband’s conduct. Nevertheless they
were ready to jump at each other on the slightest
provocation. Once the situation reached a crisis
and the woman pointed a revolver at her husband
threatening to end everything in a terrible tragedy.</p>

<p class='c004'>The children divided between the contesting parents,
taking sides. The son was entirely with his
mother. He was unhappy because she had to put
up with so much and he goaded her on all the time,
urging her to carry the fight to a successful issue
and even advising her to seek separation from her
husband. He had nothing good to say about his
father, outside the latter’s business ability. He described
the father as a cold-blooded fellow without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>a heart, a mere adding machine, etc.... On a
superficial examination it looked as if he loved his
mother and hated his father. But back of that
hatred there stood the carefully preserved love of
his earlier years. That love, however, he was unwilling
to acknowledge. That was the critical point
in the analysis. He always recoiled whenever the
analysis led to his fondness of the father, or various
signs pointed out his aboriginal attitude towards
the father. Any analysis leads sooner or later to a
similar experience. Nothing is more difficult than
to dissolve the father hatred and reduce it back to
its infantile components,—love.</p>

<p class='c004'>But in his homosexual acts he played the rôle of
the father who is tender with the child. We also
perceive now why he felt himself suddenly attracted
to that elderly gentleman with the energetic face.
He was an image of his own strict father.</p>

<p class='c004'>Having witnessed in his childhood a terrific
struggle between man and woman, and having himself
taken a part in that merciless struggle for supremacy,
he was bound to conceive the problem of
love as a struggle for supremacy, a competitive
struggle in the will to power. His supreme question
always was: “<em>Who is the stronger one?</em>” This
case shows us with remarkable clearness the mechanisms
on which <em>Alfred Adler</em> lays such great stress.
But it also shows the incestuous love for the sister,
a tendency of which he was aware. In the young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>men he sought the reproductions of his sister’s picture.
He also showed a fixation upon the mother,
with whom he was seldom on agreeable pleasant
terms. Nevertheless he has not forgotten the early
tendernesses of his father. In the wish to be
squeezed to death, his masochistic fancies revolve
around the masked image of his severe father standing
like a shadow. To be master, to be slave—his
whole system of thinking revolved around these two
notions. He has social intercourse only with men
towards whom he feels himself superior. Already
as a child he chose his comrades among the children
of the poor, because he could domineer them. He
abandoned one friendship because his friend made
jokes at his expense. He was not a handsome child.
That drove him into the path of hatred and envy.
He hated all women because they were his rivals
with the father. He thought he would have been
liked better if he had been a handsomer fellow.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was a slave to his family and unable to wean
himself away. He moved to another city in order
to free himself of the family ties. That made him
homesick. His mother had to visit him. He was
proud when they went on walks together and were
taken for a pair of lovers. But secretly he really
yearned for his father, and never forgives himself
that he did not interrupt that vacation journey to
go to his father.</p>

<p class='c004'>In reality he continued the struggle between his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>parents. Within him struggled man and wife. Possibly
also the child, though acting more in the rôle
of a bystander, and ready to give the stereotypic
answer “both” to the question, “whom do you like
better?” He thinks he has overcome the man in
him. I consider his homosexuality a passing phase.
He will achieve health only after complete emotional
detachment from the family circle.</p>

<p class='c004'>We often note that the neurotic gets well only
after the death of one of the parents or of both.
But in many cases, the parents even after they are
dead continue to hold their sway over the infantile
soul and their dominion ends only with
the death of their child who, in that devotion to
them, loved but himself and loved himself unto
death....</p>

<p class='c003'>The complete analysis of a homosexual would
require a whole volume. Before concluding the present
work I propose to give a portion of such an
analysis. The treatment lasted six weeks, when it
was interrupted by the war. This analysis, too,
only led as far as the father complex. But even
so it yields important data and enables us to draw
together the observations made in connection with
the various briefer illustrations already discussed.</p>

<p class='c003'>84. Mr. Sigma, a student from Denmark, 28
years of age, consults me on account of various nervous
difficulties. For a number of months past he
has felt very depressed, is always fatigued, generally
unable to sleep and unable to concentrate on his
work. He is facing his final examinations but is
unable to study. He complains of a lack of any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>sense of joy in living. He admits having entertained
also ideas of suicide which he has rejected
chiefly on account of his mother. He is very much
afraid that he may yield some day to just such a
temptation.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sigma is consciously homosexual. He emphasizes:
He has never felt any interest in the female
sex and already as a child he fell in love only with
boys. He is the only son of a very hard-working,
brave, mother in comfortable circumstances who is
wholly wrapped up in him. His father died a few
years ago. He lives a wholly retired existence, he
has no friends,—for his mother prevents that.
Once—he was 17 years of age at the time—he had
a close friend to whom he felt very attached, but
his mother interfered and broke up their friendship.
Now he is completely isolated. All his spare time
he devotes to his mother, when he is not gone to the
theater or to a concert. He also visits no families;
his mother prevents it.</p>

<p class='c004'>He begins—spontaneously—an account of his
life with his first recollections:</p>

<p class='c004'>I was 2 years of age and we—a number of children—played
out of doors. A pretty lady walked
up and threw a ball into the grass. She said: He
who catches the ball may keep it. I was nearest to
it but did not dare to trespass upon the finely kept
lawn. Therefore another one caught the ball....</p>

<p class='c004'>This recollection seems typical of Sigma. Like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>all first recollections it contains the determinants of
his whole life.<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c012'><sup>[34]</sup></a> It shows us a man who lacks self-confidence,
whose activity is inhibited by considerations
regarding others. He explains that for the
sake of his mother he has renounced all pleasures in
life. He is always hesitant (<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">kleinmütig</span></i>), overwhelmed
by his feeling of inferiority and dares not
assume any important enterprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>His sexuality awoke very early. He played always
with girls and felt more like a girl. He liked
to put on his mother’s hat and clothing. His mother
was the master in the house, the breadwinner and
law giver. The father always played a subordinate
rôle. We see again a reiteration of the fact that the
child identifies itself with the stronger parent.
Under the circumstances it was natural that Sigma
should identify himself with the mother....</p>

<p class='c004'>Already, in the public school, at seven years of
age, he fell in love with his teacher. That is why
he became one of the best scholars. He also loved
some of his colleagues, but was too bashful to betray
himself to them. At 12 years of age he began
to masturbate and during the act his fancies were
centered on the image of a naked man. He was
very religious up till that time and during confession
distinguished himself by the lengthy list of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>his sins and the depth of his dejection. At 12 years
of age he became free and progressively developed
into a full-fledged atheist. The struggle against
masturbation began at 14 years of age, when he
heard that the habit was very harmful. After that
he indulged more rarely. Great feeling of fatigue
on day after pollution. The subject regards his
present condition a consequence of his masturbation
habit.</p>

<p class='c004'>Already during his gymnasium years (high school)
his mind was distracted and he barely managed
to squeeze through his finals (<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Matura</span></i>). He
was always bashful and avoided the colleagues who
spoke cynically among themselves about girls so that
he was called “Miss Sigma.” For a few years he
lived away from home. They lived formerly in the
country and he had to stay in Copenhagen. He
lived with some older sisters with whom he did not
get along very well. He played music with them,
joined them on walks, experienced considerable excitation&#160;... short of erotism. His whole erotic
feeling was directed only to men and boys. In the
course of his endless day dream fancies he never
thought of a woman at any time in his life. He
dreams only of men and thinks only of them. That
concludes the first visit.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sigma again emphasizes his one-sided inclination
towards men. Nevertheless he must correct a small
detail of his account as given on the previous day.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>This, I repeat, is a common typical occurrence in
the anamnesis of homosexuals. When giving an
account of their life they neglect entirely all the
heterosexual episodes. But today Sigma adds that
occasionally he did have erotic dreams concerning
women; perhaps four or five times. But not more
often than that. These dreams led to pollutions
and were rather indefinite as to content. Sigma
was also in love, transiently, with a girl cousin, at
sixteen years of age. He at once attempts to
weaken the force of this declaration: it was merely
a pastime, a pose, because an uncle was in love with
the same girl. He thought it was his duty also to
make love to this girl cousin. But it was soon over.
And he must emphasize again that he never indulged
in any phantasies centering on women. He
had such phantasies. But they were always about
men.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was brought up almost wholly in female society.
If his mother was away, there was an aunt
in the house who looked after him. He was taken
to school and was called for when he was already
a grown-up boy—the typical training for dependence.
His mother wanted to procure friends for
him. There were always some boys whom she wished
he would accept as his friends. But usually he
himself found nothing in those particular boys to
interest him. If he himself chose some boy for a
friend his mother was sure to interpose her veto as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>soon as their friendship became too warm. And he
was always prone to fall in love with his friends.
He composed poetry at a very early age, deifying
his friends; to this day his poems are devoted almost
wholly to Eros Uranos.</p>

<p class='c004'>At this point he reflects for a while; and he continues:
“I identified myself always with the female
figures who were mostly strong, aggressive women.
I could always enthuse over such strong, energetic
women displaying male aggressiveness about them.
If a woman or a girl ever interested me and played
a rôle in my day dreams, she was of this type.”
Next he recalls a heterosexual episode. He admired
for a time the landlady’s daughter, kept company
with her, they played music together, but he
felt very unhappy when she married off afterwards.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Eulenberg trial made him aware of his own
homosexuality. That made him very unhappy for
he discovered that he was unlike others. In the
high school he was always looked upon as peculiar
and he kept aloof from his schoolmates. The famous
trial made it clear to him that his end would
be either insanity or jail. He went through some
dreadful days. He was in love with a friend and
when the latter asked him why he was so depressed,
he broke into bitter tears and poured out his heart
circuitously describing his passion. He felt that
he was not like others, he felt lonely and closed in,
unrecognized and weak. His friend advised him to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>devote himself more to art. He looked upon the
subject’s suffering as due to thwarted ambition.</p>

<p class='c004'>His typical dreams are concerned with pursuit
by men and breaking in. A particular dream made
a strong impression on him: He was pursued in bed
by a great mass of bedbugs and finally himself
turned into a bedbug.<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c012'><sup>[35]</sup></a> Like all homosexuals he
had for a time the fear of infection and especially
of tuberculosis. He was almost convinced that he
would die prematurely of tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c004'>We are also familiar with tuberculosis (as well
as syphilis) as the representative of what is evil,
of incest and homosexuality. But for the present
our patient sheds no light on this aspect of the subject.
We do not care to influence Sigma and therefore
do not disturb the course of his associations.
Sigma shows but little interest in the analysis. He
is mistrusting and hesitant. He does not have much
time and seems relieved when the sitting is over.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next sitting opens as follows: “I have come
to ask you to make an appointment with me for
tomorrow. I want to skip today. I must take a
little rest and gather strength. Yesterday’s sitting
has sort of taken me to pieces....”</p>

<p class='c004'>During the first couple of sittings I had hardly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>spoken a word and had allowed Sigma to do all the
talking. But the flight reflex, which dominates all
homosexuals, because they are afraid of the truth,
is here already coming to surface:</p>

<p class='c004'>“What roused you so yesterday?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That you kept so quiet. It was an uncanny
silence....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Would you have preferred to see me excited?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No.... I know, of course, that the physician
must keep his balance. But that is precisely what I
lack. What an awful impression I must have made
on you!”</p>

<p class='c004'><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hinc illae lacrimae!</span></i> The subject is concerned
over the impression he makes upon the physician.
He wants to know whether the physician has sympathy
for him, whether he is impressed or indifferent.
He is afraid of making himself appear ridiculous.
The physician becomes the chief person
around whom his own life interests are being centered
for the time.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But that is irrelevant. You want to get well;
and that has nothing to do with personal matters.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To be sure,—that is just what I was saying to
myself. Doctor, you are my last hope. And yet,
I am already losing patience and feel like running
off. It is less than two weeks since I went to purchase
a revolver intending to shoot myself. The
plan fell through only on account of my lack of
adroitness. I was unable to procure a revolver.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>The saleslady demanded to be shown a purchase
permit and I did not have one. There must have
also been a tremor in my voice. I was so excited....
If I had been able to procure that revolver I
would not be now sitting in your office.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why did you want to die?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A life full of trouble! No friends! No prospect
of improvement! The everlasting depression!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And did you not think of the suffering you would
have caused your mother? To your mother who
sacrificed her life for you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, I was indifferent about that. It would have
only served her right, because it is she who has
ruined my life. It might have been the end of her
too.... But I was truly sorry for my friend. He
has so many cares and so much to think about. It
would have shaken him up. He is a writer and is
now at work on a new novel. It would have certainly
thrown him out of the writing mood and it
would have interfered with his creative activity.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What has your mother done you that you should
want to punish her so severely?”</p>

<p class='c004'>This brings out the last repressed grudge against
the mother who came near separating him from his
much beloved friend.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mother has ruined my whole life,” he continues,
“she has separated me from my only and best friend.
You have no idea what I suffered. He came daily
to our house. He accompanied me on the piano so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>that we enjoyed unforgettable evenings together.
Father was once a good singer. As there was no
accompanist at hand he neglected the beautiful gift.
Now we resurrected the old songs once more. Every
evening was a festival. On account of a pulmonary
apical catarrh I had to go to Egypt. During my
absence a catastrophe occurred. Mother found
that my friend was robbing her of a son’s love. She
was jealous because he heard more often and received
longer letters from me than the parents. She
compelled my father to write Ernst a curt letter
forbidding him to come to the house any longer or
to correspond with me. From Ernst, to whom I
wrote regularly three times weekly while he answered
once, I received next an ironic letter, stating
that I ought to enclose the parent’s permission next
time I write him. Only then will he write me again.
I did not understand what that meant until I read
the enclosed father’s letter. I felt like one against
whom the gates of heaven have been suddenly closed
tight. I returned to Copenhagen at once, but did
not dare to take openly a stand against mother.
She had a bad heart spell the first time I reproached
her bitterly and all the relatives called me her murderer.
I made up secretly with Ernst and met him
on the street. But mother found out. She followed
me stealthily and when she discovered that I was
meeting Ernst there followed terrible quarrels which
I am unable to relate. I was thus very badly embittered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>and that innocent relationship was turned
into a morbid whim. You will appreciate, therefore,
that I cannot but hold a grudge against
mother....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you not tried to rebel openly against the
situation?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was too weak for that. Father begged me not
to disturb the happiness of our family circle. It
was a terrible situation and I did not see my way
out of it. That happened when I was 19 years of
age. I have since told mother that I must meet
Ernst once in a while. She is against the idea and
wants to link me up to other friends. I am brought
into contact with girls in the hope that I will take
an interest in them. But the very fact that they
are brought in my way under mother’s patronage,
as it were, makes them repulsive to me from the
outset. Moreover, I know that mother would be
equally jealous if I should really love a girl. She
will stand for no other love besides her. I am too
broken up to ever break away and be self-reliant.
So I remain everlastingly a mother’s boy. But I
cannot endure this sort of thing any longer. I have
had enough of this torture and want to see an end
to it....”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I feel much better. Last evening I worked fairly
well, for the first time in a long period. I am beginning
to like Vienna. I was out in the woods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>(<em>Wienerwald</em>) and I was pleased with the sight of
the first violet. I am again beginning to feel pleasure
in nature’s beauties. It was my first excursion.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t you go out of doors otherwise?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, every Sunday. Always in mother’s company.
We start in the morning, have our lunch out
of doors and spend the day together.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you not go on excursions with your friend?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Unfortunately, I do not. But hold on! I did,
just once. I was going to tell you about it anyway,
today. He invited me to join him with a number
of his colleagues on an excursion to a distant
island. I was enthusiastic over the plan at once
for I hoped that it would prove an opportunity for
greater intimacy between us. But I was disillusioned.
We were happy the whole day. I was
thinking all the time of the night. I hoped we would
have a room with double bed.... Unfortunately
all the rooms in the hotel were taken and we had to
be content with occupying quarters in common.
Here, too, luck failed to serve me. My friend slept
next to another member of the party. Next day,
under the pretext of fatigue, I started back. I
felt unhappy and was all day long on the point of
tears. I reached the next village alone. It was on
a holiday. I did not know what to do. So I went
into the church....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To pray?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not at all. I was no longer religious at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>time. I went to be among people. It did no good.
The many dressed up folks, the holiday atmosphere,
the music, the songs, the organ. I calmed down a
little. Next I went to a restaurant because I felt
a great craving for something sweet. Thus the
majestic and the trivial stand close in my case.<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c012'><sup>[36]</sup></a>
Then I returned home, after first driving around
through the streets and was happy when it was so
late that I had to go back to the house....”</p>

<p class='c004'>There follow various accounts of his passion for
his friend Ernst. He always dreams of physical
union with the friend and has no other thought.
Only once he attempted aggression on his friend.
In a urinal he suddenly reached for his friend’s
penis. The latter good-naturedly avoided him and
never afterwards referred to the incident. But he
saw clearly that he would never achieve his aim.
Meanwhile his friend fell in love with an actress.
He was jealous only so long as his friend did not
confide in him. Thereafter he was happy because
the actress preferred another man and paid no
attention to Ernst. He was in a position to console
his friend like a mother. He emphasizes that
his feelings are distinctly maternal towards men
who are ill or unhappy and that he makes an excellent
nurse,—thus bringing out his pronounced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>identification with the mother. But he was unable
to nurse his father when the latter was taken with
gastric cancer; the disease was terribly repulsive
to him....</p>

<p class='c004'>He has dreamed the following dream:</p>

<p class='c003'><em>I am called up in school. I had to solve a mathematical
problem but could not arrive at the right
result. Next it was an English translation from
Shakespeare. I did not know the vowels. It seemed
that the various persons of the play were represented
by some of the colleagues in theatrical costumes.</em></p>

<p class='c003'>The analysis of this dream would lead us into
endless bypaths. The most important feature is the
affective character of the dream which in simplest
terms may be formulated as follows: “I am facing
problems in life for which I do not feel prepared.
I am an actor and I am wearing a theatrical costume.
I am playing the homosexual, I have transposed
one aboriginal trend into another. The
English play, <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, comes to his
mind. The teacher who examined him in mathematics
was also <em>Kaufmann</em> (merchant) by name.
This <em>Kaufmann</em> is the center of a rather tragic
episode in his life. He was studying “exact” branches
(<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Realschule</span></i>) but was interested in the classical
(<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gymnasium</span></i>) course; he was always weak in mathematics;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>he failed in his last examination for engineering.
His attitude towards money matters has
always been morbid. His mother continually reproaches
him for not appreciating the value of
money and for being unable to handle money wisely.
He is different from his parents, both of whom are
merchants.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The <cite>Merchant of Venice</cite> portrays the tragedy of
the relations of a Jew to his only daughter. She
runs off with her beloved and abandons the greedy
father, who, however, never begrudged her anything.
He wants to do likewise. He would like to
flee with his friend and abandon the mother. His
basic problem is: how to get around his mother, how
to free himself of her.</p>

<p class='c004'>He places great weight on the jewel box scene,
which has always impressed him. He, too, is confronted
by the difficult problem of a choosing among
the boxes. There are three paths open before him:
man, woman and child. He is a child, would like
to be a woman and is afraid to be a man. His inner
conflicts are locked up like the valuables in the
box. We shall see whether analysis is capable of
disclosing them....</p>

<p class='c004'>There are some vague relations to Shylock’s coldbloodedness.
He emphasizes the pound of flesh. The
associations lead to certain sadistic trends which
are wholly unconscious. At any rate, the first
dream in the analysis is of greatest significance. Its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>complete solution and interpretation becomes possible
much later....</p>

<p class='c004'>He dwells for a long time on his attitude towards
money. One familiar with dream analysis at once
suspects that this money complex has its bearing
on anal eroticism. He keeps to his theme. Requests
to leave early.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again comes very late and asks whether he may
leave early. He is hungry. (One notices his extremely
resistant attitude. He is afraid he might
disclose something.) He has dreamed wild and profuse
dreams, he can no longer remember what. He
must have spoiled his stomach for he vomited in
the morning.</p>

<p class='c004'>This vomiting in the morning, a symptom which
appears in many neurotics and also in the case of
many neurotic children is a reaction of the ethical,
moral self against the dreams of the previous night.
Plainly, one is disgusted with one’s self. Hence the
vomiting which is subsequently ascribed to something
inoffensive that may have been eaten on the
previous evening. But the subject believes that the
beer he drank did not agree with the dessert....</p>

<p class='c004'>He is asked whether he can recall at all the dream.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, not a trace.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Better try and see.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I only remember scraps; nothing worth mentioning.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Please tell me these scraps.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>“I have dreamed only about various water closets
and urinals. There was a urinal here and one in the
office&#160;... the rest is gone. I cannot recall.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The vomiting in the morning seems to me to
point at something going on in the urinal which
strikes you as disgusting.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“May I not have simply spoiled my stomach?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Indeed. That is a possibility not to be excluded.
But the other is also a possibility to be
thought of. Do you often vomit in the morning?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, but only as I did today. Only fluid. It is
more a nausea than real vomiting. May I leave
now?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know that I never compel you to stay.
Only I want to draw your attention that I am fully
aware you want to hide something from me. How
do you imagine you can get well if you do not have
the courage to confide in your consultant? Or perhaps
you are afraid that you will lose something of
my respect if you should disclose the peculiarities
of your sexual life? You are anxious to run off
and keep your secret. Very well. You are free to
do as you wish. But do not expect, under the circumstances,
that a consultant should spend his time
on your case. One who wants really to get well
must first be willing to face his problems clearly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are right, doctor. I have kept from you
the most important thing: I do indulge in a form
of sexual excitation which is perhaps the most unpleasant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>possible. You will appreciate at once why
I have kept the knowledge of this from you so long.
I thought I have told you already too much and I
wanted to keep to myself this particular morbid
turn. But you will surely despise me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I despise no sufferer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Already as a small boy I had felt the greatest
interest in the water closet. My wish was always:
to see another man in the act of defecating. In
my school fancies I always thought of the teacher
being compelled to defecate in my presence. I was
always trying to watch other men in the act. If I
succeeded in witnessing the act I became very excited
and masturbated. My whole mind and thought
to this day revolves around the water closet and the
feces. Think of it! I, a person with certain æsthetic
tastes, an artist, poet, enthusiastic musician,
a man aspiring to all that is beautiful and noble,—to
be fettered down to so horrible a perversion!
Think of this abyss between my body and my soul!
If I become acquainted with a new man and I like
him, my first thought is: I should like to see him
empty his bowels.”<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c012'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you perhaps, as a child, witnessed such a
scene which may have made a deep impression on
you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I do not remember. I only know that already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>in the primary grades I was interested in watching
my schoolmates. In Denmark there is a greater
freedom about these matters than elsewhere. Sexual
freedom, too, seems to me to be greater in our
country. In later years I found sufficient opportunity
to satisfy my craving. Finally I had recourse
to a tiny augur which I keep always with me
as an aid to secure the opportunities for observation
which have now become indispensable to me.
But usually I find boring holes unnecessary. Little
appropriate convenient holes may be found when
one looks for them. I must have many colleagues
for I have found that most closets show these observation
spots. Here in Vienna, too, I have seldom
come across a water closet, where it was not possible
to watch the act. I fight with all my powers against
this unfortunate trend. But I give in each time
again. I think of it all forenoon. By noontime I
am wholly out of patience. I am impelled to seek
a public lavatory. There I wait till a man comes
along. When I see him defecate, I masturbate....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you watched women, too?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, I find women disgusting when I think of
them in this situation.”</p>

<p class='c004'>We are here confronted with a form of anal
erotism of a pronounced infantile character. All
children without exception show a great interest in
the lavatory and in the processes of micturition and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>defecation. These processes form the theme of a
whole group of infantile sexual theories. The children
come through the anus, they are generated
through the urine, etc. It is quite likely that we
have here an instance of the fixation of certain infantile
impressions. The fact that the first phantasies
which he is able to recall revolve around his
teacher, proves that someone who was an authority
played a rôle as the intermediary for these early
infantile impressions. Who can that authority be?
We can only surmise. We must await patiently
the further development of the analysis.</p>

<p class='c004'>He complain that he has an ugly appearance,
because everything about him is so unprepossessing;
his whole physiognomy seems to him womanly, soft,
and the obverse of striking. He often turns to the
looking-glass and examines himself. As in the picture
of Dorian Grey he finds the traces of his paraphilia
expressed in his features. He symbolizes his
mental processes and localizes them in his face. He
fights, a relentless fight against his scatologic phantasies
and trends, he seems to himself weak, womanly,
repulsive. Vice, low thoughts, animal cravings, low
passion—all that he sees expressed in his face.</p>

<p class='c003'>His first recollection of his paraphilia is noteworthy.
He is playing with a little friend, an uncle,
who wants to defecate near the street. He points
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>out that people may pass and prevents the deed....
This recollection already indicates the two
tendencies: the coprophiliac trend and the struggle
against it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Moreover, his coprophilia reaches farther than
he has confessed thus far. We discover today that
there is present a predisposition to coprophagia,
that the condition is really a mixture of homosexuality
and stark infantilism. He would like to
allow the partner to defecate on him. Identifications
with lavatory come to surface. The place
chosen for the deposition of the feces is the abdomen,
occasionally the mouth. There are also frequent
phantasies of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fellatio</span></i>, active and passive. The
reading of various medical and popular books excites
his phantasy and feeds his paraphilia.</p>

<p class='c003'>He relates two dreams. In the first he was running
after an electric car which he could not reach.
He tried to jump on but in vain, the car just passed
before his nose. In the second dream he led his dog
for a walk, the dog met another and copulated while
he himself ran off. The first dream represents an
unattainable ideal. The second illustrates the endeavor
to get rid of the animal-like trends (within
himself). He avoids similarly coitus with a
woman.</p>

<p class='c004'>He relates that for a long time he has been in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>the habit of writing up phantastic homosexual orgies
and that he carries around these erotic stories
for months. The last story he wrote some 14 days
ago. He is much interested in these doings, because
the writing and the reading excite him tremendously.
He tells me the content of the last phantasy which
he has written up: A round table of sixteen soldiers.
One of them holds a naked woman on his
knees. She must urinate in a glass. The soldier
pours beer in that glass. Then all those present
partake of the beer.<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c012'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>He confesses next that he has already carried out
a number of times various urolagnic acts and felt
great pleasure doing so. In fact these cravings did
not bother him only so long as the friend visited
him daily and he was keeping up his spiritual love
for the fellow. That is why he was so broken up
when his mother deprived him of that friend.</p>

<p class='c004'>He relates a number of episodes illustrating his
activity as <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyeur</span></i>. At first it was chiefly men of
advanced age who roused him. They had to have
very clean and attractive linen. Ejaculation ensued
when he had an opportunity to see the man
naked and the phallus interested him more than the
podex.</p>

<p class='c004'>He also admits having entertained phantasies
about his father. But he found these phantasies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>unbearable and they proved at last so discomforting
that he had to abandon them. On the other hand
he was able to state emphatically that his mother
never figured as an erotic object in his fancies.</p>

<p class='c004'>As a genuine homosexual he was very much surprised
that a “naked woman” should figure in his
last phantasy or story and he could not explain
the intrusion. But he is telling me everything without
reserve....</p>

<p class='c004'>He fears that perhaps his mother is having some
understanding with me. She is in the habit of tracing
all his secrets.... I point out to him the fact
that the mothers of homosexuals always show the
strongest opposition against the analysis when they
find out that their sons free themselves and turn
their affection (temporarily, of course) to the
analyst. Sigma’s mother, who has accompanied him
to Vienna, also tolerates no intimate friendship on
her son’s part, as we know. Thus he tells me that she
had reproached him yesterday for leaving her alone
on Sunday. She wants to be everything to him.
She also tries to be tender with him, to coddle him,
a habit which he strongly resents. He believes that
this resentment is due to his aversion against all
womanhood. This sort of protection against all
tendernesses on mother’s part is typical of all sons
who are incestuously fixed on their mother.</p>

<p class='c004'>He relates how his mother once confessed to him
that she found no support in his father and actually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>felt lonely. On that occasion he wept over
his mother’s plight and passed a sleepless night....
His further associations lead him to his
father’s fatal illness: it was a slow breaking down
due to cancer. He could not take care of his father,
and was but of little service to the latter. It was
shortly after his father had dismissed his friend.
He was still too absorbed in his own troubles. He
witnessed with detachment the terrible phases of
the dying man’s last struggle. A few days before
the end he dreamed that he saw his father’s body
lying peacefully on the bier. It was plainly a dream
of impatience. He could hardly await his father’s
passing away. He declares that he hated his father
heartily at the time, because the latter had allowed
himself to be induced by the mother to write that
letter to his friend. Strangely, he was never so
angry with his determined mother as he was with
his weak-willed father. During the father’s funeral
and upon returning home he was unable to weep.
This occurrence is typical of those men for whom
a death is the fulfillment of an old wish. In point
of fact the father was a burden and drag in the
house. The mother sacrificed herself and his death
was a release for everybody. Moreover his attitude
towards his father had always been rather
peculiar. They had never had much in common....</p>

<p class='c004'>He reports a number of small details illustrating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>how tirelessly his mother endeavors to bind him to
herself. Yesterday afternoon he was at the theater
and later went to the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Prater</span></i>. In the evening he
found his mother morose and pouting. She looked
at him reproachfully saying: “Did it not occur to
you during your rounds of pleasure that you are
leaving your poor mother alone?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He must think only of his mother and always feel
that he is bound to her forever. Aunts and neighbors
always come to him to tell him how much suffering
he causes his poor mother by neglecting her.
While he was still suffering acutely the distress
caused by his mother’s breaking up his friendship
with Ernst, he met the latter once secretly and they
went to a theater together. The mother knew it
in some way and when he returned home he found
her in bed, her head wrapped in towels. Her disappointment
made her ill and she had to keep to her
bed for a week. Finally an aunt accused him of
behaving like a murderer towards his mother. She
cannot understand that passion of his for that
friend! Was he perhaps in love with the young
man’s sister? Happy to have a way out of his
difficulty suggested to him he answered the question
in the affirmative. That roused his mother’s jealousy
to the highest pitch. But she soon convinced
herself that she had been fooled by him and that he
had no interest whatever in the girl.</p>

<p class='c004'>He found the household ties so unbearable that at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>one time he entertained the notion of shooting his
parents and running off. There were frequent quarrels
during which he displayed unexpectedly a terrible
venom against his mother and an unexplainable
tendency to violence. But these episodes soon
blew over, and he again felt himself helpless under
the tyrannic sway of her love. Perhaps not as unwillingly
as he makes out&#160;... for there were opportunities
available for freeing himself and he did
not take advantage of them. He remained inactively
at home, to be taken care of and to allow his
mother to worry over him....</p>

<p class='c004'>He dreamed of visiting numerous urinals running
from one to the other. This dream portrays him
as searching for something. It appears that he is
trying to trace down a particular infantile scene.
He relates how obsessed he becomes with the desire
to go from lavatory to lavatory until he finally sees
the longed-for scene. He is seldom satisfied. Often
there follows a feeling of disappointment and disgust.
Occasionally an uncommon sense of peace
during which he is able to gather his thoughts.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I did not tell you the truth when I denied transvestitism
(<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Verkleidungstrieb</span></i>). I often entertain
such fancies. I am particularly fond of Salome
and I often portrayed myself in that rôle with
keenest interest. My teachers were the prophets
whose cold, severed head I kissed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This trend distinctly sadistic is fortified by numerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>small details. He is jealous. He saw once
his friend entertaining himself in friendly and
lengthy conversation with a lady and the thought
occurred to him that perhaps his friend was in love
with her. He figured that he would be justified to
take his friend’s life for he loved him more than any
one else in the world. He pictured to himself that
deed and what he would do to his friend. The chief
motive he confessed reluctantly: “I should abuse
sexually his body.” With that fancy there is linked
also the portrayal of immense sadness.</p>

<p class='c004'>The two features he mentions today are represented
in the <cite>Merchant of Venice</cite>. A scene which
always excited him, representing transvestitism.
Portia as judge and the Jew bent on carving out a
pound of flesh. Shylock and Salome. The bloody
head of John is obvious enough.</p>

<p class='c004'>Today, too, he is in a hurry and must get through
quickly. He is always relieved when the hour is
over. This raises the suspicion that he is trying to
cover up further revelations....</p>

<p class='c004'>He relates particulars regarding his homicidal
fancies against his friends. His favored phantasy
is the thought of pushing his favored friend into
an abyss. They often take walks on the seashore.
At a certain spot the coast is very steep and rocky
and a fall there would mean certain death. He is
also obsessed with the reflection: what would he do
afterwards? Run away? No&#160;... he would jump
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>after his friend to be united with the latter in
death....</p>

<p class='c004'>The next dream carries us deeply into the structure
of his homosexuality. First he relates the
dream as he had written it down and then he adds
reluctantly the portion indicated as “additional.”
The addition usually contains the most important
features.</p>

<p class='c004'>The dream just before falling asleep:</p>

<p class='c003'><em>Place</em>: <em>the grotto across the</em> Schönbrunn <em>Castle.
I was descending the rocky incline and reached the
lowermost declivity. I was very much afraid of
falling into the water basin. I was wondering what
to do, and I had the feeling that back of me, instead
of rocks there were high stairs which I could
never climb up. Suddenly I found myself on level
ground, beyond the water. An automobile passed
me by noiselessly and with lightning rapidity disappearing
specter-like in the bushes. I saw no
driver and nobody else in the machine. It seemed
very uncanny but presently I knew that I was at
home and in my bed. I should have liked to keep
on dreaming but the wish to hold on to what I had
dreamed thus far prevailed over all other desires.
I was afraid I should forget my phantasy so far
as it had unfolded and that I should have nothing
to report to my consultant.</em></p>

<p class='c004'><em>Shortly afterwards I fell actually asleep and i
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>dreamed a great deal. I have tried to recall some
of the things in the morning. It seems noteworthy
that the dreams were but lightly intimated rather
than carried out; there was always still something
more about to take place but the next dream picture
intruded before the previous one was all done.</em></p>

<p class='c004'>Additional: <em>Once I found myself in a theater
in the first row of a balcony. Tristan was being
given for the occasion. Instead of the orchestra
leader, André Rose was leading. A fine one-year
volunteer</em>, Einjahrig-Freiwilliger, <em>back of me, in the
second row, was singing Tristan in the style of the
modern recital song. Next to me sat my aunt who
is linked with memories of my kindergarten age. I
had the unpleasant feeling that I was involuntarily
sliding down towards the ground floor, and therefore
I leaned heavily back in my seat stretching out
my legs and trying to support myself by pressing
my toes against the foot support (bed foot-board?).
I had the uncanny feeling that the foot rest might
give way and fall off like a piece of paste board. I
begged my aunt to lift me carefully. I felt like a
very sick person. Sitting again upright I felt well
and refreshed and I was just in time to see the curtain
drop over the stage and a number of persons
appearing in front of it, among them several gentlemen
in evening dress. Obviously the performance is
being cancelled. The public broke into ironic applause,
whistled and howled.</em></p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Another dream: <em>Late at night in a big garden.
Many people about to take their leave after an
afternoon spent in irrelevant gossip. My parents
were also among those present. My father was in
a hurry to get to town. He leaves. It is very dark.
Presently a station bell, the whistle of a locomotive.
I shout into the night’s darkness not knowing
whether any one hears me or not: he is lucky! He
is just in time to catch the train. And I think of
following in an hour. I am very tired. I am happy
in my bed at home.</em></p>

<p class='c004'><em>Sunny afternoon in a poor quarter of a suburb.
Under a window of an apartment window there are
a number of tin vessels which I know, belong to the
woman above. An elderly woman is preoccupied
with the vessels, holding each vessel up to the light,
as if testing them, but I know that she is merely
awaiting the opportunity to run off with them. A
window is raised in the neighboring house, a woman
calls out to the woman living in the apartment
under whose window the vessels are lying, to watch
out for the stranger. By that time I myself am
standing in the owner’s room. She is just putting
on her best toilette. The warning neighbor appears
and scolds the vain woman who on account of her
vanity neglects to watch out for her things.</em></p>

<p class='c004'>Addition: <em>I was in the next room. The woman
had a little girl with her. I held my penis in hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>pursued the two and wanted them to take it in their
hand; and thus the ejaculation....</em></p>

<p class='c004'><em>The woman’s hands disgusted me because they
were dirty.</em></p>

<p class='c003'>This is hardly the place for a complete analysis
of the whole dream. The first part, the falling into
a deep basin is a hypnagogic vision and represents
the process of falling asleep, the descent into the
depths of primordial man. The rapidly passing
automobile, the danger. The representation of
Tristan refers to a great passion for a queen.
<em>Schœnbrunn</em>, the former Kaiser’s summer residence,
refers to the parental home. Isolde is also a queen,
who is lost forever for Tristan. Is it not rather
remarkable that he should dream of Tristan and
Isolde, the quintessential epic of heterosexual love?
And does not the cancellation correspond precisely
to his cryptic wish? The thought of a fall into the
depths is continually recurring as well as the inhibitions
about things not holding out (hence the
steadying with the feet for support). The man in
evening dress represents the love of a modern cultural
man in contrast with a Tristan. He himself
is Tristan, the onlooker and the singing <em>Einjährig-Freiwillige</em>.
Finally another picture: parting, <em>i.e.</em>,
his father’s death: “He was lucky.” What is the
meaning of that? He has caught the train on time!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>Recalling that in one of his previous dreams the
subject was unable to catch the electric car, we
understand that his father found time to attain his
aim,—a tempo—while he himself is late. We shall
be informed presently about the meaning of this
aim. And back of all inhibitions another picture
breaks forth: he runs after an old woman with his
erect membrum (the child is a symbol for the genitalia.
<em>Cp.</em>, in this connection, <cite>The Language of
Dreams</cite>, <cite>Dreams and Sex</cite>, Chapter, “Children in
Dreams,” translation by <em>James S. Van Teslaar</em>, Badger,
Gorham Press, Boston, 1922).</p>

<p class='c004'>He is not a little surprised that his dreams portray
heterosexual feelings. Heretofore he had paid
no attention to his dreams.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have not yet stated whom the old woman represents.
He is asked to mention any woman that
occurs to him and after some hesitation he states:
my mother.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here we come across one of the roots of his homosexuality,
one that perhaps we anticipated. But
thus far I avoided any inquiries about his attitude
towards the mother.</p>

<p class='c004'>What is the meaning of that portion of the dream
which portrays a number of tin dishes? I perceive
this as follows: He does not possess many treasures,
it is all mere tin, but such as it is it all belongs to
the woman above&#160;... the mother. The neighbor
warns the mother that another woman might rob her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>of her son’s affection. The mother is very vain and
spends considerable time preparing her toilette.</p>

<p class='c004'>The key to the dream rests in the pollution with
which it ends and the deepest effect: the disgust on
account of the dirty, unclean hands of the woman
above.</p>

<p class='c004'>We see that the pollution is slowly prepared.
First there is a representation of the heterosexual
love (Tristan). But his inner voices—the public—express
themselves against that love, the latter is
deprecated: there is whistling and shouting and
ironic applause. Next the father is upon the scene
of action. He is represented in the act of leaving.
Other women appear,—the old woman, the neighbor.
But the orgasm is achieved only through the “woman
above” (“upstairs,”—<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Frau da oben</span></i>, literally, woman
above),—the mother. This form of pollution, which
at bottom represents merely an unconscious onanism
(unclean hands!) brings on a feeling of disgust in
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next dream portrays a scene in which a man
talks about his son. The scene takes place in a
lavatory. Probably this reproduces an infantile
scene wherein he may have observed his father at
the lavatory. The dream following that is much
clearer. I reproduce here both:</p>

<p class='c003'><em>I found myself in a lavatory compartment and I
watched my “victim.” The man turned his back to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>me and spoke to himself about his son. I noticed
that the woman guardian was keeping watch on me
from the outside and I started to leave, grabbing
my hat just as she was opening the door to catch me
at my observation post. I acted as if I were unconcerned,
quietly picked up my handkerchief on
which I had knelt down, picked off the floor the
various things of mine that were still strewn about,
gloves, muffler, etc., and went off with the feeling
that through my cool behavior I disarmed the
woman of her suspicions and had avoided a public
scandal....</em></p>

<p class='c004'><em>I went upstairs to a wide open store. Half way
across I saw the saleswoman standing in a corner.
At the sight of her I am seized with tremendous
bowel cramps. I turned around and defecate publicly
in the room. The woman over there will not
see me?</em></p>

<p class='c003'>This dream reminds him of the childhood incident
already mentioned: When he was two years of age
he was playing out of doors with another boy who
prepared himself to move his bowels close to the
street, in the open. Now he admits also that his own
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">libido</span></i> is greatly increased if he imagines he is
watched during defecation. This is a typical instance
of sexual infantilism. He is not only <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyeur</span></i>;
he is also exhibitionist.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first dream discloses the fear that the mother,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>the guardian, might find out his scatological tendencies.
In the second, the woman upstairs was the
onlooker during an infantile scene. It reproduces
undoubtedly a frequent scene of childhood.</p>

<p class='c004'>He has carried out a number of homosexual acts
at public baths. In Denmark the men bathe together
in steam rooms. Thus he had opportunity
to permit himself bodily contact with others to the
extent of inducing <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ejaculatio</span></i>. He must also add
something to yesterday’s dream about defecation.
Once at the seashore he heard a man groan in the
lavatory. He climbed upon the side wall and saw
the man masturbate. This so excited him that he
climbed down at once and also masturbated. The
stranger revenged himself by looking on in his turn
and that increased tremendously the subject’s <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">libido</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>His dreams today are very characteristic.</p>

<p class='c003'><em>I am in a carriage and I am playing with an infant
in swaddling clothes. I would gladly be rid of it. A
man advises me to pack the child in a tin box,<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c012'><sup>[39]</sup></a> and I
actually do to.</em></p>

<p class='c003'>Interpretation: he wants to be rid of his infantilism;
he preserves it in a tin box. Compromise between
the two trends. The next dream relates about
a minister of the gospel who stands before a big hole
in the ground and who interprets that hole to mean
that asceticism is not a possible ideal. It is necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>to masturbate, at least occasionally. There
were roots in that hole, which looked like hair. Next
he is with his mother in a carriage. The mother
turns into the holy Madonna or the holy Zara(?)</p>

<p class='c004'>The earth, too, stands for the mother: mother
earth. The hole refers to both, birth and death.
One comes from the mother and returns to the
mother. The mother appears again as the holy one,
and as the Czarina, hence the mystifying Zara. The
father is the Czar, just as in the Tristan dream he
is represented by the king. Further meaning is
obvious.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hairs recall his peculiar attitude. Women’s hairs
are abhorrent to him. His mother has long blond
hair. The father was very hairy. Formerly all
hairy men were abhorrent to him. Downy, young,
feminine men are his ideal. He is continually seeking
woman in man....</p>

<p class='c004'>He reverts once more to the dream about the hole
in the ground. He now recalls that dream very
clearly.</p>

<p class='c004'>I am again a pupil at school and I am being conducted
to confession along with the other school
mates. We stand in a wide, round amphitheater
scooped out of the ground. The natural wall rises
to a height of about 2 meters, all around. Above
it there stands a wonderful temple-like edifice. A
monk points to the wet spots upon the earthen walls
and compares them to the erotic thoughts, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>are also not to be rooted out of the believer’s conscience.
I notice a bunch of roots on the wall and
involuntarily I think of pudendal hair. The monk
condemns asceticism.</p>

<p class='c004'>A dream full of religious meaning. Already in
some of the previous dreams the woman “upstairs,”
or “above,” was perceived through religious over-determination
as mother Mary to whom alone his love
belongs and which he therefore must not squander on
any earthly woman. He sees his grave which like a
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">memento mori</span></i> admonishes him to regard this life as
a preparation for the next.</p>

<p class='c004'>Woman seems to be here the quintessence of sinfulness.
Now we understand why the woman upstairs
had a little child by her. It was little Jesus.
He has soiled his pure faith. The brain which holds
his belief (the earthen wall!) is likewise stained with
his sinful erotic thoughts.</p>

<p class='c004'>The great wall surrounding the place to a height
of a couple of meters symbolizes all the inhibitions.
He himself is the monk, he had a passing desire to
become an ecclesiastic, he is a heterosexual
ascete....</p>

<p class='c004'>Last night many dreams of going through urinals.
In one urinal he found a man who instead of a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">phallus</span></i>
had a vagina.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dissolute dreams. Among others a dream that he
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">podicem lambit</span></i> a friend. He also entertains consciously
fancies of like character.... Further
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>dreams of mutual masturbation with a strange man.
Finally the scraps of dreams culminate in a lengthier
one in which he finds himself in the company of
the girl he was very fond of as a boy. The struggle
against the heterosexual tendencies goes on throughout
the night and finally he is conquered.</p>

<p class='c004'>Obvious resistance against the uncovering of the
heterosexual tendencies.</p>

<p class='c004'>One dream out of a large number deserves to be
reproduced:</p>

<p class='c003'><em>I go on a walk with mother. We are tender with
one another and she tells me sweet words. I pluck
wonderful anemones from a river and want to make
a garland to crown my mother with it. But the
petals fall off and only the empty green stems remain
in my hand.</em></p>

<p class='c003'>Any one familiar with the symbolism of plucking
flowers (<em>vid.</em> my <cite>Dreams and Sex: The Language of
Dreams</cite>, translated by <em>Dr. James S. Van Teslaar</em>,
Badger, Gorham Press, Boston, 1922, Publisher)
will readily recognize that this is a reference to an
indulgence of an erotic nature. These love pats lead
to empty stems. The love cannot come to blossoms or
fruition.</p>

<p class='c004'>He dwells on his relations with his mother. It is
virtually a marriage without any erotic elements.
He does not tolerate his mother’s tendernesses and
he has asked her to refrain. There is now between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>them genuine shyness. Erotic matters are never
so much as touched upon. Against his incestuous
leanings he secures himself by the wall of an apparent
aloofness. But they live together, they go out together,
they share every enjoyment. His mother
is a woman who has a grip on his whole life. And at
bottom he is not angry because she has interfered
with his other friendship. He understands her, that
is, he sympathizes with her. That friendship was
an attempt to free himself of the mother. But the
mother instinctively did the right thing when she
stepped in between her son and his friend. He does
not at bottom care to be liberated from the slavery
of his affection. He allows himself to be led about
and to be treated as a child. He talks as if the love
and the chain were disagreeable to him. Both trends—towards
the mother and away from her—are active
in his soul: bipolarity.</p>

<p class='c004'>The treatment should improve his neurotic condition
only but should not interfere with his attitude
towards his mother. He dreams that he is well and
that he tells his mother, now he is all well and they
are going to be happier together than ever.</p>

<p class='c004'>In connection with a dream another love affair
comes to surface, dating some 16 years back. He
courted a certain girl and sent her some poems. He
thinks it was mere play, an attempt to “imagine”
that he was also capable of loving girls. That is
how he endeavors to dismiss lightly his heterosexual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>tendencies. But he thinks that the love poems were
irrelevant. He also composed poems to his mother,
when he was away from home for a short time:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Du meines keuschen Herzens Allgebieterin,</span></i></div>
      <div class='line'><i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der ich mich neige in tiefer Demut</span></i>&#160;...”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>“You, mistress of my chaste heart,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>To whom I bow in deep humility</em>&#160;...”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The verses are full of yearning and passion. His
blood calls for her, his heart is filled only with yearning
for her. These are the utterances of a man who
has lost his head by falling in love.</p>

<p class='c004'>This case illustrates plainly the manner in which
monosexuality leads to homosexuality. But the subject
himself did not want to recognize any of these
relations. All the powers of sublimation at his disposal
he had turned into his love for the mother.
Therefore he had to cling to a portion of his mysophilia
(dirt compulsion). What he overdid on one
side in the way of cleanliness was compensated for
on the other by a sinking into filth. It is noteworthy
that he does not care to be cleared of his homosexuality.
He looks upon it as a protection and as
something that sets him apart from other men. This
again shows the hopelessness of any therapeutic endeavors
in most cases of this type.</p>

<p class='c004'>Since taking account of his dreams he is astonished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>how often heterosexual excitations come to the surface.
Last night he dreamed, first, that he was with
a naked woman, of wonderful build and that he <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
vaginam et in anum immisit</span></i> his finger.</p>

<p class='c004'>Further, another remarkable dream, which played
an important rôle in the solution of his neurosis:</p>

<p class='c003'><em>I am with mother at the Opera. A long hallway
at the end of which one obtains a view of Vienna.
One sees the wonderful St. Stephen’s Church, a fine
cloud like a smoke or like a fine powdery water spray
over its tower. The Opera is changed. Instead of
Don Juan, the Donna carissima.</em></p>

<p class='c003'>Already the first dream indicated a definite trend
towards woman and now the change of program discloses
the source of his neurosis. I ask him for a
description of the woman in the first dream. He
did not see her face at all. He merely saw the wonderful
bewitching white body.</p>

<p class='c004'>Such dreams—figures without faces—are very frequent
and serve to hide the beloved person and to
prevent recognition. I know dreamers who have pollutions
with such half figures. The face is never
visible. Often only a portion of the body. Through
the second dream we may assume that the figure
represents the mother. Otherwise it is hardily possible
to explain why the face should have been subjected
to the dream’s censorship.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>The second dream belongs to the category of maternal
body fancies. He is within the mother’s
womb. The long passage he associates with: life’s
pathway. It is in fact the pathway through which
he came into life. Stephen’s tower is a phallic symbol.
The smoking room, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ejaculatio</span></i> or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mictio</span></i>. It is
a representation of the illusion that he is within the
maternal body and is able to observe from that
point of vantage the process of generation. The
dream becomes even more transparent when we learn
that his father’s name is Stephen.<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c012'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>Now his sexual infantilism becomes intelligible.
He is under the spell of <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mutterleibsphantasie</span></i>, maternal
body phantasy. Every lavatory becomes for
him the symbol of the maternal body. There he
watches the man urinating as he might have watched
the father in the maternal body if he had had enough
intelligence to do so as an embryo. It seems unbelievable
that intelligent persons should become victims
of so puerile a phantasy. Various facts always
uphold the sense of such a phantasy. In this
particular instance there was dislike for, and unpleasant
sensations in, closed rooms, also a series
of paraphiliac trend which found their explanation
only through that phantasy. He revelled in the
thought of permitting himself to be besprinkled
with the spermatic fluid by his beloved male friend;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>he had a craving <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">membrum erectum amati viri fellare</span></i>;
his urolagnic and coprolagnic proclivities, too,
were dominated by the same phantasy. He behaved
as if he were still in the maternal body.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the dream declares clearly that a change of
program is taking place in the play of his life. Don
Juan becomes a <em>Donna</em>—<em>Carissima</em>,—she who is
most dear to him. He has changed programs; and
the love for the father he has transferred to his
mother. He is within the maternal body,—he himself
is the mother. He seeks himself, he is his dearest
woman, he loves the womanly in himself. We have
here the never absent love of the homosexual for
himself—narcissism.</p>

<p class='c004'>Various recollections come to surface, all showing
alike that his earliest predisposition was distinctly
heterosexual. Thus, for instance, at five years of
age he fell in love with a girl, wanted to marry her,
and called her his bride. We hear only of three
heterosexual episodes belonging to his later life.
It is not yet clear how this complete turning away
from woman came about. Further inquiries reveal
dreams of which I can only give a part. Thus he
dreams:</p>

<p class='c003'><em>I study for an hour. My textbook is on various
physical experiments, further on it turns into history.
There is something in it about Bavarian
history. The year 4005 plays an important rôle.
The whole thing ends with a fairy tale about three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>pines which stand on a winter’s night before the
house and signify three dead women.</em></p>

<p class='c004'><em>Later I act successfully as an imitator of women.</em></p>

<p class='c003'>The figure 4005 brings the following associations:
00 is the sign for lavatory; 45 is the opus number
of one of his favorite opera scores, the Salome of
Richard Strauss; 4 and 5 are the bad marks at
school.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Salome of Strauss and a previous dream lead
us to his sadistic trends. It becomes progressively
clearer that his aboriginal sadism was extraordinarily
great. To this day he revels in phantasies
about sexual crimes, violent murders, etc. He toyed
with the plan of killing himself as well as his whole
family. Any opposition at home immediately suggests
to him thoughts of murder. His original attitude
towards woman, too, was sadistic. The chief
motive of Salome is the severed head of the prophet.
Also the pound of flesh in Shylock, in the first dream,
refers to this trend; finally the dream about the bedbug.
His religious trend set in early, thus protecting
him against the wild beast within him. At six
years of age he played that he was a preacher and he
had his own altar. He fled from woman because he
was not sure of himself....</p>

<p class='c004'>He has a large number of idiosyncrasies which may
be explained through a repressed sadism. He cannot
eat peaches because their skins resemble human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>skin; he cannot tolerate the skin on parboiled milk,
it brings on disgust and nausea; he often turns
against meat and for a long time he confined himself
to vegetarianism. Meat he calls animal carcass. The
thought of a menstruating woman is particularly repulsive
to him. All associations with blood are
strongly affective, partly in a positive and partly in
a negative way.</p>

<p class='c004'>What is the meaning of the three pines which
symbolize dead women in the dream? Has he lost
three female ideals? He associates with “<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ein Fichtenbaum
stand einsam im Norden auf kahler Höhe</span></i>,”
etc., “a pine tree stood lonely on the bleak heights
of the north,” the famous poem by <em>Heine</em>. That pine
tree dreams of palms in the glowing climate of the
Southern Country. There are no further associations.
The theme “dead women” is met with considerable
resistance.</p>

<p class='c004'>I pass over a number of days which amounted
merely to a preparation for the coming solution;
and I shall report merely the most significant of the
dream material.</p>

<p class='c004'>Very important appears the following dream:</p>

<p class='c003'><em>Standing with father at a wide stream. A little
white steamboat departs from us, turning and twisting
like a reptile. I would have liked very much to
be on it (though I do not know where I could have
found place, it was like a microcosm). The ship is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>delayed and now we have to return by train. That
the ship would have made better time is an opinion
I dare not share with father.</em></p>

<p class='c004'><em>Next day I enter a grotto through which a number
of others are wandering ahead of me. The pathway
is tortuous and leads upwards. Who among my acquaintances
is joining me I do not know. My whole
attention is centered on snakes which I carry on a
cord. They have very friendly heads, yet somehow
I have the impression they can bite. I say to
some one close by that their poison glands have
already been removed. Eventually I reach a house in
full daylight and at the top they turn into dogs
who escape my control and quickly clatter down the
deep stairway. Presently they are back and allow
meekly to be held in leash.</em></p>

<p class='c004'><em>At home I find a package of handkerchiefs neatly
wrapped in tissue paper.</em></p>

<p class='c003'>This is a combination of a spermatozoon dream
and a maternal body phantasy. The stream in which
the tiny boat is moving about, the life stream, the
stream of spermatic fluid carries a particular spermatozoon,
himself. He, now grown up, wants to revert
back to the tiny thing, wiggling like a reptile.
He wants to be tiny again, not a child merely, a
spermatozoon (<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Samenfaden</span></i>). He is dissatisfied with
life and would like to begin his life all over. The
path leads from the stream into a grotto cave,—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>maternal body. At the same time the dream symbolizes
his whole life, which leads him upwards through
pitfalls and dangers to the sunshiny heights. His
thoughts are represented here as snakes. They
have friendly heads, to be sure, <em>i. e.</em>, sin beckons, but
he holds them captive. All sins are overcome, all
snakes are captive and wear muzzles. The shiny
house is the church. Thus this dream shows the
life’s beginning and end.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next dream about handkerchiefs, becomes intelligible
when we find out that he masturbates into
his handkerchiefs. The packing in tissue paper
shows that the specific masturbatory phantasy is
covered up.</p>

<p class='c004'>The dream is concerned with the father. During
the last few days he has been thinking a great deal
about his father. He tells me about that:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have had some hard days and I only see now
how strongly I was fixed on father and what a tremendous
rôle he has played in my life. Yesterday
I felt in me all the strong hatred that I bore for
years against father.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why did you hate your father?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In the first place because he made me and passed
on to me his weakly characteristics. Such men
should have no children. I have taken over all his
morbid predispositions. Then I hated him because
he parted me from my friend through that letter
which he wrote at mother’s behest.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>“Then you ought to hate your mother. Is it
not strange that you should condone the same conduct
in the mother but not in the father? You seem
to appreciate your mother’s side but not your
father’s.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Naturally, when you put it that way I see clearly
that I was unfair to father. The letter was but an
excuse for the great hatred. I recall with shuddering
his last day. I had the feeling that father was
afraid of me. He gazed at me continually with his
great glassy eyes while holding on to mother’s hand.
I felt something like jealousy over mother,—now I
know that I was always jealous. My maternal body
phantasy means, of course, that I want to be present
at the parental love act. I want to replace the father
in mother’s life. As a small child I loved him
very devotedly and I suffered on account of his coolness.
He was immeasurably loving and devoted;
nevertheless I felt that there was something lacking.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He looked for tendernesses from his father. To
this day he indulges in two phantasies during his
sexual acts. He is the boy watching his father during
coitus. That is the particular lavatory phantasy
when he watches elderly men. He permits himself to
be used as a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">receptaculum seminis</span></i> by a favored person.
(Strong desire to carry on <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fellatio</span></i> on his teachers
or to subject himself to pederasty.) He is within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>the maternal body <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">und wird vom Vater päderastiert
oder felliert</span></i>. Or else, he himself is the father, he
identifies himself with the latter, and seeks young
boys who in that case stand for himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>But we see that these phantasies differ as widely
as possible from reality. He is unable to secure
his contact with reality, because he is continually under
the sway of the maternal body phantasy, as
shows by his peeping into lavatories.</p>

<p class='c004'>His love for the father proves to be the strongest
root of his homosexuality. He wanted to assume
the mother’s place in the father’s life. In his phantasies
he is either the father or the mother; he
has not attained his own individuality. He loves
himself either with maternal or with paternal feelings.</p>

<p class='c004'>I record the following dream among many others.
It shows us his typical attitude towards the mother:</p>

<p class='c003'><em>Am going with mother to the country where we
expect to spend a few days to recuperate ourselves.
Locality: forest neighborhood. The journey, stopping
station, roadway familiar partly from actuality
partly through precious dreams. Wonderful woods
with fragrant blooming flowers. But the blooms
show numerous brown spots of decay, as after excessive
rains. Elder bushes badly torn up by the
weather and by plunderers. The path leads to an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>incline which offers a view of the numerous villas in
the valley. I find that we have wandered off, in
order to reach the place where we proposed to stay
for a while; we should have taken the path to the
right half way up the road.</em></p>

<p class='c003'>This dream represents a love whose bloom is decaying.
They have wandered off (note the double
meaning of the expression, <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">vergehen</span></i>), and they are
off the right path.</p>

<p class='c004'>His past is illumined not only by his dreams.
Among his youthful compositions he finds a poem
which portrays clearly a paternal body phantasy and
speaks longingly of the time when he was yet “unformed
and rested quietly in his father’s loins.”...</p>

<p class='c004'>The revelations in the course of the following days
bring to light new associations. His reveries continually
slight the immediate past and carry him
back over a number of generations. He is a person
of wonderful ancestry, he is not at all the son of his
father, he is a child whom gypsies have changed in
the cradle, he has fallen into the midst of his family
by accident.</p>

<p class='c004'>It turns out that two lives were much talked of
at home and that has had a great deal to do with determining
his life course and specifically his fear of
woman. In the first place, there was his father’s life.
The man had been previously married to a woman
whom he caught in a breach of marital faithfulness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>and it led him to fight a duel. He carried a scar on
his forehead as a memento. Then, an uncle took his
life when he found out that his wife whom he considered
loyal, proved unfaithful.</p>

<p class='c004'>These lessons stood before his eyes already when
he was a mere boy. They served as terrible warnings:
beware of woman!</p>

<p class='c004'>During the next days his fear of woman is the
chief theme of his associations. His father’s and
his uncle’s fate stand before him as a perpetual
warning. Already as a small child he had absorbed
very clearly the thought: one must beware of women!
His mother did everything to fix permanently this
fear in his mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>But every fear is the fear of self. This fear
of women must have a deeper determinant. The
deeper relations are indicated by the following
dream:</p>

<p class='c003'><em>I am on the street and it is towards evening. The
roadbed in front of me is badly torn up. A wagon
drives by; it rolls past at dusk and the farther end
of the street is already plunged in darkness. Horse
and driver will not be able to see that the road is
torn. A powerful bear jumps up to warn the horse,
the driver draws tight his reins, the animal turns
around at the same time holding his head anxiously
away from the torn pavement until he finally reaches
again the straight road. Before the wagon disappears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>into the night the powerful bear jumps once
more at it.</em></p>

<p class='c004'><em>I am tremendously roused to think that such wild
animals are sent out as warning. There might be
small children in the wagon who would be frightened
to death.</em></p>

<p class='c003'>Every statement in this dream is a psychic disclosure.
The dream records his life’s journey. A
portion of the street is torn and impassable. He can
only go through the homosexual pathway. The heterosexual
is so broken up as to be unusable. It is
dark and he might easily meet with disaster in his
life’s journey over this point. The darkness symbolizes
the forgetting of the aboriginal determinants;
the driver is consciousness, the horses are the instincts.</p>

<p class='c004'>A bear warns him of the dangers of the torn-up
road. He is angered at this form of warning. The
reference to small children shows that the warnings
date back to childhood, when he was actually threatened
with a bear.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There may be small children in the wagon who
would be frightened to death,” records the dream.
As a child he has heard repeatedly about his uncle’s
suicide, because of the wife’s faithlessness. In the
depths of his soul this story could not but act as a
perpetual warning against woman. The story of his
father’s duel, too, and the latter’s scar on the forehead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>influenced his childhood and filled him with
fear of woman.<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c012'><sup>[41]</sup></a> It made him resolve to submit to no
woman. And is not hatred the surest self-defence
against the dangers of love?</p>

<p class='c004'>Who or what is the mysterious bear in the dreams?
Naturally,—like every figure in the dream, it is the
dreamer himself. There is the power of a wild beast
in his breast. We recall that one of his dreams was
staged at <em>Schönbrunn</em>, the Zoölogical Garden of
Vienna, where the wild beasts may be seen. We
recall Shylock, the pound of flesh, and the various
sadistic determinants of his neurosis.</p>

<p class='c004'>We now approach the kernel of his homosexual
neurosis which turns out to consist of a powerful
protective wall against his criminal self. His attitude
towards woman is characterized by a tremendous
hatred. He is a <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lustmörder</span></i>, the wild bear
who attacks women, who strangles them and would
drink their blood. The bear represents his own image
and a terrible warning.</p>

<p class='c004'>Beware of the women! It will turn you into a
murderer. Better remain a child, enjoy whatever
brings gratification to a child. Woe to you if your
life’s journey should lead you through the open road
where all wild passions lurk which have already filled
you as a child! Oh, better if you had never been
born, or if you could begin life all over....</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>Blood is his true requirement. Spermatic fluid,
urine, fæces,—all these are substitutions representing
blood.<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c012'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>Now we begin to understand why he must not be a
man and why he wants to be a woman. His great
aggressive trend is linked with the notion of maleness.
The passive attitude, suffering, patience, is identified
with femaleness.</p>

<p class='c004'>After these revelations, which were supported by
a large mass of memories, the patient stayed away
for a few days. Then he reappeared and told me
that he had successful intercourse with a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">puella publica</span></i>.
He thought he might be able to overcome his
homosexuality. But he received a telegram recalling
him to Denmark.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have not heard anything about his subsequent
history. Did he become bisexual? Did he overcome
his infantilism? Did the torn portion of the road
become passable at last?</p>

<p class='c004'>I am unable to state anything definite. But we
have obtained here a clear insight into the psychogenesis
of homosexuality and we have seen that many
determinants are at work shaping the original predisposition.</p>

<p class='c004'>Let us briefly mention the most important data in
this clinical history. It must be looked upon really
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>as but a fragment of an analysis. But it leads us to
the core of the neurosis and shows us the subject’s
inner predisposition, so sharply contrasting with his
conscious attitude.</p>

<p class='c004'>This man carries within himself the aboriginal instincts
of mankind. His dreams carry him back to
the paternal body and back to the prehistoric phase
of his existence not without reason. He carries within
himself the engrams of thousands of years, the remnants
of the wildest instinct of primordial man. The
phylogenesis of his being corresponds with his ontogenesis.
What does he lack for a typical primordial
being? In his dreams and phantasies he shows the
terrible blood lust, the imperativeness of wishes, the
brutal egoism of the periods of long past. Even
man’s primordial toleration of filth is not absent;
this subject’s history discloses urolagnistic and coprophagic
tendencies.</p>

<p class='c004'>Consider the contrast between his instinctive and
his cultural self. He is a man of refinement and a
marked personality, a genuine artist, a man who appreciates
the beautiful, a man who is transfixed before
a representation of Tristan, or before a statue
and whom the beauties of nature plunge into ecstasy;
a man who seems capable of adding some day to the
world’s art possessions a worthy contribution.</p>

<p class='c003'>This case proves most decidedly that my view that
homosexuality represents a regression is correct.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>Other physicians will prefer to speak of degeneration.
Indeed,—but this subject has no sign of physical
degeneration, there is no pathologic family history
such as might be regarded as predisposing to
degeneration. One might as well consider all artists
degenerates inasmuch as all artists show the primordial
cravings which we find in our patients. The very
fact that all human progress is brought about
through individuals who represent regressions
should teach us more carefully the term degeneration
and to apply it only to the cases in which the
conjunction of physical signs of degeneration with
moral inferiority leaves no doubt.</p>

<p class='c004'>We trace here the operation of that primordial
hatred which threatens to smother the mind’s safety
valve as it presses for expression. A portion of this
hatred may turn into love and lead the subject into
the pathway which makes prophets, religious reformers,
philanthropists or champions of the people. Another
part of it persists and strengthens infantile
trends.</p>

<p class='c004'>What is <em>Sigma’s</em> conscious attitude? Love for
men, indifference towards women, hatred of the father,
a bipolar vacillation towards his mother,—love
and hate!<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c012'><sup>[43]</sup></a> But unconsciously he loves his father
and hates all women,—perhaps because he must
love them. His ordinary attitude requires the projection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>of his love feeling in its bipolar form upon
all the objectives of his affection. One loves and
hates at the same time. But he hates only the
women. How has this primordial hatred been attained
by the subject? Why is he incapable of assuming
the usual bipolar attitude towards women?</p>

<p class='c004'>If we go far back into his childhood we find that
he was in love with his father and jealous of his
mother. At that time all women were possible rivals
in love for the father. He himself wanted to be a
woman, the woman to love his father. This father
<em>Imago</em> he seeks to this day in all his teachers, older
friends, in his superiors. He must necessarily stand
in a homosexual relationship towards them so long
as he is unable to overcome his infantile constellations.
Everything peculiar about his attachment to
the mother is traceable back to his identification with
the father. From the latter he has derived his quiet,
timid, patient temperament,—that attitude of passivity
which really masks a tremendous aggressivity.
That infantile attitude determines the survival of all
infantile excitations in his <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vita sexualis</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>How may the cure be effected? The subject must
be made to understand that he will never really carry
out the crimes which contact with women suggest
to his unconscious. He must learn to apply love in
its bipolar form alike to men and women. His plethora
of cravings should enable him to awaken within
himself the hitherto badly neglected love for woman.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>Before the analysis all his erotic trends were directed
towards male friends. The cure leads through
approach of woman as friend. First she is a friend,
and subsequently—after much struggle and searching—the
beloved. He must learn to play the rôle
of father to some strange woman.</p>

<p class='c004'>Is analysis the proper means? Who, in the
present state of our knowledge, knows another?
What can we accomplish through commands, punishment,
formal training, or hypnosis? Primordial love
achieves supremacy only through the exacting process
of self-knowledge and through the recognition of
the primordial instincts, including the primordial
hatred. The subject has concentrated his primordial
love feeling wholly upon his own person.</p>

<p class='c004'>Like all homosexuals he loves only himself. This
peculiarity, too, he shares with all primordial beings.
Does primordial man know any other love than
love of self?<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c012'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>I have already pointed out that <em>urnings</em> always
seek themselves first and assume subsequently the rôle
of another person; or else they seek in the male different
variants of their own childhood. The same is
true <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pari passu</span></i> also of the <em>urlinds</em>. To be in love always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>means to find one’s self in another. But why
do <em>urnings</em> not find themselves in the female <em>Imago</em>?
This question cannot be covered with a generalization
that will hold good for all cases. In the two
last cases the fact that the subjects regarded themselves
as the reverse of handsome played an important
rôle. They had a sense of inferiority with regard
to woman and a feeling of envy. Self-love induced
fear of defeat by woman on account of lack
of attractiveness. How could they feel confident of
conquering woman in view of their ugliness? How
could they play the rôle of a Don Juan to which their
latent homosexuality might otherwise have driven
them? Among men physical beauty does not matter.
What is important is the size of the genitalia.</p>

<p class='c004'>If love capacity be measured by the size of one’s
genitalia, the patient <em>Delta</em> (Case 83) could measure
himself against any one. He took ridiculous pride
in his great penis,—a pride shown by many men.
His whole sexuality was centered upon the symbol of
masculinity. With <em>Sigma</em>, with whom the penis
played but a secondary rôle, the case was different.
<em>Sadger</em> who sees in narcissism the love of one’s genitalia
would find his view corroborated by the history
of the first case but not by the second, the subject
in the latter instance showing not the least interest
in his penis.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first of these cases portrays the mechanisms
described by <em>Adler</em>, the second barely a trace. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>shows how easy it is to build certain assumptions
through a one-sided selection of cases. It is obvious
that every earnest investigator must come upon certain
aspects of the truth. What we obtain always
are mere sectional views of homosexuality. A cross
section yields merely a corresponding view of the picture.
Only the apposition of the various sectional
views can furnish us the proper perspective for reconstructing
the whole picture of homosexuality.</p>

<p class='c004'>Infantile reminiscences in both cases were partial
determinants which lead to a lasting fear of women
and to withdrawal from heterosexual love. <em>Delta</em> had
witnessed an unhappy marriage as a child, <em>Sigma</em>
heard a great deal about faithlessness and about
woman’s lack of loyalty. Both shared also a strong
sadism, a feature which we have observed in all cases
of homosexuality thus far analyzed.</p>

<p class='c004'>We are thus led to a synthetic formulation of
male homosexuality which, in reversed terms, holds
true also of women:</p>

<p class='c003'><em>The homosexual neurosis is a flight back to one’s
own sex induced by a sadistic predisposition towards
the opposite sex.</em></p>

<p class='c003'>We have seen with what powerful hatred the homosexual
encounters his environment. Whether he
turns his hatred towards the other sex, his own, or,
under certain circumstances, against himself, he remains
the inveterate hater vainly trying to reconcile
the feeling of man’s aboriginal nature with the
ethical requirements of later culture. The question
rises whether he is at all capable of loving. One may
point out that in a certain sense he does love his
mother, father, some friend or that perhaps he even
has a “sweetheart.” But it only seems that he loves
them! The truth is that he is unable to love. That
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>peculiarity he shares with all artists who, in fact,
are also incapable of loving. I repeat myself and
reproduce below my statements on this point as incorporated
in my work “<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Träume der Dichter</span></cite>.”<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c012'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>All my inquiries into the psychogenesis of these
disorders have led me back to the manifestations
of hatred. Already in my work, <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Sprache Des
Traumes</span></cite> (<cite>the Language of Dreams</cite>), I have pointed
out that antagonism (or hatred) is man’s primary
feeling responsible for the development of neuroses
in those ethical-minded persons who still preserve
strongly their aboriginal instinctive cravings. “<em>The
neurosis is the endopsychic perception of hatred in
terms of a guilty conscience</em>” (<cite>The Language of
Dreams</cite>, page 563 of the 1st German edition; English
version of the latter edition is now in preparation
by the translator of the present volume.)</p>

<p class='c004'>I believe I have proven successfully that the
homosexual is a neurotic, that he represents a type
of regression to man’s primordial instincts; and that
homosexuality is a sort of compromise healing process
in the mental conflict between the abnormal, raw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>cravings, and the cultural need for their suppression.</p>

<p class='c004'>But we must not think that, like the average neurotic,
the homosexual is incapable of love. Only, all
his love is a love centered exclusively on self. Yet
all cultural progress consists of the sublimation of
self-love into social love. That is the meaning of the
majestic injunction: <em>love thy neighbor as thyself</em>!</p>

<p class='c004'>Since the homosexual loves only himself he seeks
only himself in others. That, however, is a feature
of all love. What appears to be the most extreme
manifestation of altruistic feeling is at bottom but
the outcome of egoistic cravings. Love is but egoism
potentialized. Every neurotic suffers of narcissism.
He is a slave to self and cannot escape that
bondage. The homosexual loves, or appears to love,
his own sex, but even superficial examination shows
this to be but part of his narcissism. In truth he
loves neither man nor woman. He has to overcome
a hatred stronger than the corresponding feeling in
the normal. That hatred is the theme of his childhood.
As perpetual infant, he fails to sublimate sufficiently
that hatred, or to fix it upon objectives considered
proper in our current cultural development.</p>

<p class='c004'>All who investigate homosexuality find an early
awakening of the sexual instinct. It is perhaps the
greatest social function of sexual instinct, next to
reproduction, to provide for the conquest of hatred.
Though the selfish child becomes a loving person, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>child’s love is still entirely self-centered. The child
loves the persons who serve it. In vain one tries to
point out that it ought to love also the teachers
who are severe but mean well, that parents must
punish in order to teach! This view belongs to the
adult mind and is what enables the adult to forget
the childish notions of revenge which he entertained
as a child whenever he suffered punishment which he
looked upon as unjust before his higher sense of responsibility
had asserted itself. But in the neurotics,
including homosexuals, sexual precocity brings early
to surface cravings which involve the love of others;
they are therefore inclined to renounce or modify
their hatred. The proportionate share of hatred
against some beloved person is withdrawn and turned
against the others. These infantile feeling-attitudes
may undergo a second transformation in later years.
A boy may love the father and hate the mother, because
she is his rival in the father’s affection. At
the same time the sisters may be hated because they
draw to themselves a certain quantum of the father’s
love, which the self-centered jealous boy wishes to
secure exclusively for himself. Later the mother
and sisters are loved, and the father recedes to the
background.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jealousy is an infantile feeling. Its appearance in
later years always signifies a regression to infantile
attitudes. The homosexual spreads his hatred from
one persons to the whole sex under the form of jealousy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>Let us assume that he loves the father insofar
as he is at all capable of loving. The mother is
looked upon as a rival. With the formulation of
that attitude, all other women become likewise potential
rivals, capable of robbing him of his father’s
affection. Therefore he hates all women,—the subject
is on the road to homosexual neurosis. At the
onset of homosexuality stands jealousy and the latter,
therefore, preserves its infantile value throughout
life.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have already mentioned that it is the function
of sexuality to conquer hatred. But that task is
never completely carried out. An eternal rivalry persists
between the two sexes giving rise to the so-called
“struggle between the sexes.” I have no doubt that
man’s capacity for loving has increased in the course
of our racial evolution. What subtle refinements our
erotism has undergone! How complicated the
psychic processes displayed by the man and the
woman in love! But the antagonism or hatred which
divides the two sexes has grown apace. Modern love
owes its profuse affectivity to this conquest of hatred,
this periodic regression back to the feeling-attitude
of hatred and its renewed subdual.</p>

<p class='c004'>The question arises: Have we in fact any proof
that the polar tension between man and woman has
diminished? He who fails to see a proof of this in
the improvement of woman’s social position and her
acquisition of equal rights may turn to biologic facts.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span><em>These biologic data prove that the sexual differentiation
between man and woman has increased with
growth of culture.</em> In primitive times woman was
not so womanly, the man less manly, than the man
and woman of civilization. <em>Fehlinger</em><a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c012'><sup>[46]</sup></a> compares
the primitive peoples with the Europeans and shows
that <em>the secondary sexual characters are much more
pronounced among the civilized peoples than among
the savages</em>. Subtler stimuli are required to excite
the domesticated sexual instinct.</p>

<p class='c004'>That sexual differentiation is more pronounced
among Europeans is shown also by the fact that the
period from the onset of sexual adolescence to the attainment
of complete physical growth is more prolonged
among civilized peoples than among the colored
races. The primitive races show a great similarity
between male and female types and that is
most pronounced among the various pygmean races.
The latter are characterized by an infantile physique,
which, as is well known, is sexually but little differentiated.</p>

<p class='c004'><em>Since the homosexual represents retrogressively a
stage of racial development during which the bisexual
character of the organism was more pronounced, he
carries <i class='gesperrt'>ab ovo</i> the inclination to project himself
unto both sexes.</em> He passes into the world of sexual
differentiation as into some strange, inimical, and, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>his mind, incomprehensible realm of existence. He
belongs to the primordial period in which a man, if
necessary, could have replaced the woman. His <em>engrams</em>
perceive the homosexual feeling as something
as natural as if he had come a few hundreds of thousands
of years sooner into the world. But into the
cultural age in which love plays such a tremendous
rôle he brings with him also the antagonism of bygone
ages. That feeling of hatred becomes a powerful
lever in the struggle between the sexes. Physically
he stands between man and woman but he is not
suited for the rôle of mediator because he has not
learned to subdue the eternal struggle between male
and female within his breast. The love-attitude
which is a mixture of love and hatred, he splits into
its two components directing one separately towards
each of the two sexes. Towards woman he turns his
primordial hatred, while man he loves as a representative
of culture. When he is grown up that deadly
hatred is repressed and stands a hidden stumblingblock
between himself and woman. Unable to be a
complete man, unable to extricate himself from that
infantile feeling-attitude, he also hates the woman in
him. He overvalues manliness and in his excessive
appraisal of it turns to it with his whole love. The
hatred of all women corresponds to his scorn of the
woman in himself,—a reaction due to his personal
inability to overcome the woman in his own make up
and to become a complete man. Finally in the course
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>of the continuous struggle between the man and the
woman within his breast he reaches the curious compromise
of accepting the feeling that he is a woman.
That is: he excepts a single woman from his hatred&#160;... himself. In that manner he becomes a transvestite.
He may be active heterosexually, he may,
apparently, have overcome his homosexuality, yet, as
penance for his hatred, he puts on the clothes which
had seemed once so hateful to him. <em>The latent homosexual
becomes a transvestite only on account of his
guilty conscience.</em></p>

<p class='c004'>Our investigations have proven that homosexuality
has no uniform psychogenesis. But all cases
showed an archaic emphasis on bisexuality. Although
I speak of regressive manifestations I should
not care to see that conception confused with the
notion of “hereditary taint” or of “degeneration.”
For my investigations of artists have convinced me
that they present the same tendencies as the homosexuals.
They, too, are neurotics. In fact, the
number of homosexual artists, even of homosexual
persons of rare genius, as given by <em>Hirschfeld</em>, is
impressive. I hold the view that every great creative
work has been and is being achieved through these
regressions. It is as if nature attempted to rejuvenate
herself and once more to absorb creative energy
by dipping down into the primordial source of all
energy. It might be more proper, perhaps, to speak
of them as <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dégénérés supérieurs</span></i>, in the sense of <em>Magnan</em>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>It seems to me that true degeneration, as seen
in the stigmata of physical decay, and which manifests
itself in an insufficient adjustment to the ethical
requirements of society, represents rather the terminal
point of an exhausted stem, gravitating downwards,
while the neurotic represents a progression.
Degeneration and regressions certainly have a great
deal in common. But similar causes often bring on
varying results. I need refer only to the well-known
laws of inbreeding, for instance. The summation of
good qualities through the intermarriage of relatives
may lead to the birth of a true genius, but the same
step causes more or less degeneration by reinforcing
morbid tendencies.</p>

<p class='c004'>I see in such an atavistic tendency the predisposition
to homosexuality, common to all neurotics.
Perhaps organic changes, such as I have found in
more or less pronounced form in most homosexuals
also play a certain rôle. Persons of pronounced bisexual
type do not necessarily become homosexual,
but this does not disprove that the organic condition
may be a factor. Here is where I agree with
<em>Hirschfeld’s</em> “intermediate sex” theory. But beyond
this point our standpoints diverge. The organic
factors remain yet to be investigated. We are but
at the beginning of our studies of organic bisexuality.
The ascertainment of unilateral hermaphroditism,
it seems to me, will play a particularly important
rôle in future investigations. Already the data
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>obtained through the examination of large groups
of persons, for which the World War furnished me an
opportunity, impressed me with the fact, that contrary
sexual <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Anlage</span></i> is to be found particularly
often on the left side of the body. (In men this shows
itself in the form of unilateral gynecomasty, scant
hair growth, asymmetry of the face, the left side
being more pronouncedly of feminine type.) The
finding of infantile features must also be considered
of significance in the diagnosis of an organic predisposition
to homosexuality.</p>

<p class='c004'>These interesting facts do not relieve us of the
need of establishing the psychogenesis of homosexuality
on a sound basis. But the multitude of conditions
which may lead to homosexuality admit no
hard-and-fast line. Every case is a problem of its
own; these are the very cases where we must carefully
individualize and guard ourselves against hindering
future research by laying down any hard-and-fast
rules.</p>

<p class='c004'>A question which no investigator of sexual problems
has thus far satisfactorily answered, now suggests
itself: Why is it that homosexuality and particularly
male homosexuality has become the object
of such terrific social abhorrence? Why is our
penal code so backward in that respect?</p>

<p class='c004'>We can understand the reasons for that only in
the light of the historic aspect of the problem. It
is a striking fact that although female homosexuality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>always appears along with the male, it is not
nearly so abhorred but is rather tolerated under the
cover of silence. Austria is the only European
country in which sexual intimacy between women is
a penal offence. Probably the difference in this attitude
bears some relation to the problem of reproduction,
since man, as the fertilizing agent, plays
a more active rôle than the woman.<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c012'><sup>[47]</sup></a> The seed,
that most precious possession with which a man
may fructify several women, must not be squandered.</p>

<p class='c004'>The decided struggle against homosexuality began
energetically with Judaism. Monosexualism developed
with monotheism. The Bible hardly refers to
homosexuality. The blessings of children, of reproduction,
the advantage of numbers were the needs
to which the sexual cravings had to be subordinated.
There is, therefore, justification for the contention
that Judaism has fought against homosexuality,—impelled
by social motives. On the other hand it
was also an account of another set of social motives
that, in Greece, homosexuality was not only
tolerated but permitted and even expressly introduced.
<em>Aristotle</em> is of the opinion that in accordance
with their customs and beliefs the Dorians expressly
intended to limit the increase in population
through the encouragement of boy love and the separation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>of women from society.<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c012'><sup>[48]</sup></a> But that in itself
would not explain the high regard in which homosexuality
was held in ancient Greece.</p>

<p class='c004'>I refer those interested in the subject to the interesting
work of a philologist, Prof. <em>E. Bethe</em>.<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c012'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>Like many other philosophers and investigators of
history, <em>Bethe</em> falls into the error of pointing to the
Christian church as the agent responsible for the
newer orientation in sexual matters. In the first
place these writers overlook the fact that the new
attitude had set in already with Judaism. Secondly,
they fail to see that religions are, themselves, but
the result of social conditions. Religious teachings
always adjust themselves to the social needs of their
day and even fulfill them. Religious formulæ prove
meaningless only to the progressive, emancipated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>free and forward-striving persons, the imperatives
of religion are superfluous only for those above the
average. The crowds must cling to religious formulæ
and will always need sexual inhibitions of a
religious character.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sexuality is changing all the time, it undergoes
progressive refinement. No careful observer can deny
that fact. More and more of our instinctive cravings
are gradually throttled. But when the process
of repression becomes too severe there are regressions
such as we have witnessed in the agitation for
free love of the last decades and in the current more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>frank discussion of sexual matters. But if all signs
do not fail the high tide of the agitation for sexual
freedom has passed and the wave of that agitation
is receding. Pioneers in the movement for sexual
freedom are beginning to uphold monogamy; and
the problem of population made pressing by the
World War does not favor the abandonment of the
current social and legal proscriptions against homosexuality.
On the contrary. There is likely to be in
the near future a stronger revulsion against homosexuality
inasmuch as society finds itself compelled to
revert at all costs back to the Old Testament attitude
of fostering reproduction.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have already pointed out that the secondary
sexual characters are becoming more strongly accentuated
through culture. The prehistoric stage
was probably characterized by an undifferentiated
sexual feeling, such as <em>Max Dessoir</em> ascribes to the
pre-adolescent stage. <em>The polar tension between
male and female has increased!</em> That explains the
difference between the old Greek and the modern attitude
towards homosexuality. The Greek was a
bisexual being. He was capable of loving his friend
and wife and woman slave alongside the boy. The
modern homosexual, carrying within him the bisexual
instincts of the most archaic developmental stage,
finds himself confronted with another sex-attitude.
He is confronted, so to speak, with the need of making
a new choice, and therefore he seeks always the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>type to which he himself belongs, the man who is a
woman, or the woman who is a man. Exceptions do
not disprove this rule. But in proportion as the
polar tension between the sexes increases, the basic
antagonism between man and woman also grows. As
we have seen—the last case was particularly instructive
in that regard—the homosexual, who apparently
stands above that struggle, is inspired from within
by a feeling-attitude of extreme hatred. He hates
woman with such deadly antagonism that the fear
of his own passion makes him avoid woman. His
hatred is a will of annihilation. But that feeling
involves its polar alternative: love to the point of
self-annihilation, a willingness to be utterly humbled.
Subject No. <em>83</em> gives us a history clearly illustrating
this interplay of forces.</p>

<p class='c004'>But it is plain that the number of homosexuals
will not decrease. On the contrary. <em>I am of the
opinion that under certain conditions the extreme
polar tension between man and woman will always
drive to homosexuality certain individuals possessing
the requisite bisexual predisposition and that the
number of homosexuals will increase.</em> Since I look
upon homosexuality as a neurosis, a morbid condition,
if one insists on the term, I am decidedly opposed
to the policy of penalizing the homosexual,
and against those legal proscriptions which have been
and are the cause of much misery. It is a striking
fact that in France and Italy homosexuality plays
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>a lesser rôle than in Germany, for instance, although
in those countries the offence is not so severely penalized.
Dangers and prohibitory laws often excite
the strongest attraction and the neurotic is the very
person who likes to become a martyr. Homosexual
relations or acts, carried on under mutual understanding
and with the consent of the parties thereto,
should not come under the province of penal law, as
provided in the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Napoleonis</span></cite>. The latter penalizes
only public nuisances (<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">outrage à la pudeur</span></i>)
that is, acts committed in public or carried on in the
presence of witnesses; the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Code Napoléon</span></cite> penalizes
coercion and protects the minors and the feeble-minded.</p>

<p class='c004'>With these provisions the requirements of our current
ethical standards are fully met. I cannot conceive
the State compelling the homosexuals to reproduce.
Although I do not accept <em>Tarnowsky’s</em>
viewpoint that their offspring is degenerate,—because
personal observation has often convinced me
of the contrary—I look upon the rise of the homosexual
neurosis as a sort of social instinct. The
homosexual possesses an endopsychic perception of
his asocial tendencies. He feels himself beyond the
pale of society and does not care to adjust himself
into the social order with regard to his sexuality.
His struggle against reproduction is perhaps best
for society. Considering the strength of his sadistic
inclinations we can appreciate that through his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>voluntary sterilization in certain cases he renders society
a genuine service.</p>

<p class='c004'>The question rises whether it is advisable to clear
the homosexual’s path towards woman through
psychoanalysis. That brings up the chief question
whether homosexuality is at all amenable to therapy.</p>

<p class='c004'>My personal experience has convinced me that
here and there psychoanalysis is successful in effecting
a cure. But only under certain conditions. The
homosexual must be genuinely willing to be cured.
He must actively desire a change in his leaning.</p>

<p class='c004'>But experience shows also that this will to health
is found only in the lighter forms of homosexuality
in which latent sadism does not dominate the condition.<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c012'><sup>[50]</sup></a>
That in a certain sense the homosexual of this
type is curable I am in a position to affirm on the
basis of my personal experience. The cure proceeds
spontaneously but it may be hastened through psychotherapeutic
endeavor.</p>

<p class='c004'>The proper psychotherapeutic method can never
be <em>hypnosis</em>. What may we expect hypnosis to
accomplish so long as the homosexual himself remains
in the dark regarding his false attitude, so
long as he has not learned to acknowledge openly
the repressions against which he has fought so long?
Contrary to <em>Krafft-Ebing</em>, <em>Schrenk-Notzing</em>, and <em>Alfred
Fuchs</em>, I have never met with a lasting cure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>through hypnotic treatment. We must accept with
greatest caution the statements of homosexuals
claiming to have been cured by us.<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c012'><sup>[51]</sup></a> Case <em>62</em> recorded
in this work, illustrates that there are some
homosexuals who in order to please the physician
and conclude the treatment with flying colors, claim
they are well without having changed in the least
their deeply rooted feeling-attitude. <em>Moll’s</em> association
therapy I am also unable to accept. That
method of treatment consists of the systematic development
of normal and the equally deliberate destruction
of the perverse, associations. <em>Moll</em>, who
has proposed this therapy and given it that designation,
has the homosexual cultivate deliberately feminine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>company so as to come strongly under the
specific female influences, he regulates the subject’s
reading and helps him overcome the homosexual
phantasies. The subject must think of “normal
pictures” only, before going to sleep and thus influence
his dreams in the proper direction.<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c012'><sup>[52]</sup></a> But one
must not think, as <em>Moll</em> concludes, that the heterosexual
dream pictures which follow are due to the association
therapy. The pictures thereby are merely
rendered <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">bewusstseinsfähig</span></i>, tolerable to consciousness.
They were always present. But the patient
lacked the courage to acknowledge them.</p>

<p class='c004'>I do not mean to deny a certain relative value to
the association method. It is certainly not an advantage
for the homosexual who earnestly strives to
get cured to continue to frequent homosexual circles
and to have constantly dinned into his ears
the assertion that his condition is inborn and hopeless.
I have quoted some cases showing that latent
homosexuality may become manifest through contact
with and the example of homosexuals while the
heterosexual leaning may be disturbed thereby. But
I did not intend to suggest the advisability of any
compulsory measures for restricting the homosexual’s
freedom of action or social intercourse. I
have already expressed myself clearly against compulsions
and punishments. It is advisable to urge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>the homosexual anxious to get cured to give up
contact with homosexual circles.</p>

<p class='c004'>But that the association therapy alone is capable
of effecting a complete cure I cannot but doubt. The
subject must first learn to see himself clearly and
to recognize the source of the evil against which
he is fighting. We must bear in mind the many
subjects with whom repressed sadism is the true cause
of the fear of woman. Such subjects must first
consciously overcome their sadism, they must recognize
that the fear is a ridiculous attempt at protecting
themselves against leanings which under normal
conditions never break through.</p>

<p class='c004'><em>The first condition for the successful cure of homosexuality
is adequate self-knowledge.</em> That can be
accomplished only through persistent psychoanalysis.
The physician must devote himself to the subject
for some months until the side-tracked leanings
which the patient has stubbornly overlooked are
brought into the field of consciousness and clearly acknowledged.
The subject is like a person with torticollis
looking constantly in one direction and avoiding
a turn of his head on account of the pain. This
mental torticollis must be overcome. The homosexual—if
he is to get well—must be able to turn
his gaze unrestrictedly over his whole mental horizon.</p>

<p class='c004'>That is by no means a simple task. It is an
achievement challenging the whole medical art, requiring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>insight, diplomacy, sympathy, friendliness,
and patience. But few physicians are fitted for the
task. Perhaps the opposition to psychoanalysis
would not be so sharp if it were practiced only by
competent psychotherapeutists and experienced professional
men possessing the requisite tact. The
physician is like the sculptor engaged in the task
of bringing forth a certain form out of raw material.</p>

<p class='c004'>Unfortunately I must point out in this connection
that the psychoanalytic method inaugurated by
<em>Freud</em> is in danger of falling into discredit through
careless application. On the one hand the exaggerations
of the master and his pupils have repelled
many practitioners; on the other many of the patients
have themselves become psychoanalysts, without
being completely cured of their own trouble.
What would one think of a hydrotherapeutist, expert
though he be in his own specialty, who undertook
a laparotomy? Analysis is comparable to a
serious operation requiring a steady, experienced
and skilful hand. Psychoanalysis does not permit
dilettantism like hypnosis. Only from an experienced
master may one learn the difficult art of psychoanalysis
and in turn become a master of the art.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is quite likely that the analysis of today will be
ridiculed in the future as a raw beginning. Various
subtleties and gradations remain to be uncovered
by the future generations.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>The psychoanalytic realm is not yet completely
laid out.</p>

<p class='c004'>How firmly I held to all the Freudian mechanisms
so long as the deceptive proximity of the great
founder confused my own understanding! How
much I had to unlearn, correct, tone down, or underscore,
overcome or forget, or see with a different
eye, before I realized that we are as yet but at the
beginnings of our knowledge and that we must use
our present findings as but so many spring boards
to enable us to reach a little farther out! <em>Finally,
each psychotherapeutist formulates in the end his
own technique. The most important prerequisite for
psychoanalysis—as for every scientific investigator—is
to approach the subject without any preconceptions,
to look upon every patient as a new problem
and not to be surprised if one’s case does not fit in
with one’s ready-made systems or if it disproves one’s
favorite notion.</em> For even the physician with years
of experience is startled to meet so many new forms
under which neurosis manifests itself.</p>

<p class='c004'>But in spite of the variegated pictures, this bewildering
variety of causes leading to the trouble,
one thing remains true and unalterable: the neurotic’s
unwillingness to see, that peculiarity which
<em>Freud</em> has called <em>repression</em>, and the consequent
<em>psychic conflict</em>. We must first appreciate that the
patient’s mind is shattered over the hopeless character
of his conflict, that for him the neurosis is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>necessity,—something that enables him in one way
or another to put up with his hardships,—something
with which softly to hide his wounds on the one
hand and on the other, show his suffering to the
world; when we appreciate all that, we may gradually
acquire the subtle skill of dissolving the ties
and bringing the wound to light. We see the wound
but the patient will not, cannot, see it. He may go
so far as to claim that he has no wound and is well;
that he was born with the ties that bind him; or
else, that he came with that wound into the world.</p>

<p class='c004'>These difficulties are in no psychoneurosis so great
as in homosexuality. As I have already stated: the
homosexual neurosis is a flight to one’s own sex
induced by the sadistic feeling-attitude towards the
opposite sex. It is the task of analysis to uncover
the mental conflict which finds expression in this onesidedness
and to enable the patient to see the cruelty
trend which he has derived from the childhood of
the race and has carried through his own childhood
into his adult life. <em>When the homosexual becomes
aware of his bisexuality and sees the causes of his
monosexual leaning we have accomplished the requisite
educational task. Beyond that point the patient
must help himself. If he is truly earnest about his
desire to get well he will accomplish it without being
pushed to it. If he lacks the inner will the situation
is hopeless in spite of the analysis.</em></p>

<p class='c004'>For that reason I am not in favor of the practical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>management of homosexuality as carried out by
many physicians and particularly by some psychoanalysts.
They urge the homosexual to adopt heterosexual
ways, and consider the subject cured when
he is able to have normal coitus a few times. Unfortunately
unpleasant reactions often follow alleged
cures such as are often claimed for persuasion-therapy
and hypnosis. The homosexual abandons all
further attempts and prefers his original monosexual
attitude.</p>

<p class='c004'>We may claim a cure only after the subject under
treatment falls in love with a suitable person of the
other sex. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Potentia cœundi</span></i> is not enough. He must
be able to give up dividing the feeling-complex hatred—love
between the two sexes—and to achieve the bipolar
attitude “hatred and love” towards the opposite
sex. Such a miracle only love can perform. Experience
proves that the homosexual flees from the
heterosexual love to save himself. The latter looms
up in his mind as a test of power, in which he is
anxious to come out the winner, even at the cost of
doing away with his heterosexual partner. He must
accept the subjection to woman implied in love and
recognize that in true love both lovers rule and
both obey. He must also learn to recognize the essential
unity of erotism and sexuality. Only when
the homosexual finds it possible to fix his erotism and
sexuality upon the same goal, in a person of the
opposite sex,—in other words, when he learns to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>love in adult manner,—have we the right to claim
a cure. It is only then, at any rate, that the greatest
healer of all ages, love, achieves its easy victory
and the former patient, like all neurotics, thinks
that mere chance has brought him face to face with
his ideal. With that end in view the fixation on the
family—through which the homosexual loses his
erotic freedom, occasionally also the sexual—must be
severed. I have brought strong proofs to show that
we must transform the homosexual into a bisexual
being, in order to cure him. Practical experience
does not favor bisexuality. We must reckon with
the fact that we live in a monosexual age. The
homosexual must transpose his whole sexuality and
must try to overcome or sublimate his one-sided
leanings.</p>

<p class='c004'>The necessary educational discipline takes a long
time. The treatment of homosexuality therefore is
a formidable task, both for the analyst and for the
patient. The end-result of the treatment may not
be known definitely for some years.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have tried to describe the technique of the analysis
in the individual cases. From those various
indications the reader may form a picture of the difficulties.
A systematic account of the technique
of the analysis would require a volume in itself. Perhaps
after finishing my <cite>Disorders of the Instincts
and Emotions Series</cite> I may write such a work in order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>to acquaint with my experience the practitioners
who want to grapple with the same problems.</p>

<p class='c004'>A new generation of physicians, not brought up
in the midst of the prejudices of the older, will further
the psychologic investigation of the neuroses.</p>

<p class='c004'>Naturally the high school must change its attitude
towards the problem of sex. Departments of Sexology
and Psychotherapy are necessary to instruct
the young physicians in the essentials of sexual life
and its morbid changes, in order to prepare the future
practitioner to deal effectively with these troubles,
heretofore erroneously looked upon as hopeless.
The next volumes in this Series will prove how
little the paraphilias are inborn and how much they
are the result of training and environment. But
what is formulated through faulty training may be
corrected by proper reëducation, even though the
hold of infantilism appears unconquerable.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have called the paraphilias <em>the struggle between
spinal cord and brain</em>. They are, even more truly,
<em>the Struggle of Child against Adult</em>. For at bottom
these neuroses are but infantilisms struggling for survival.
The adult fights against the child; the adult
race, ripe for monosexuality, fights against its childhood
manifesting itself in bisexuality and sadism.
The physician can see to it that the warfare is carried
on in humane fashion and with means worthy of
civilization. He can turn the hidden into an open
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>warfare. It means overcoming the evil—or that
which the moralists call evil—by meeting it face to
face.</p>

<p class='c004'>He who looks for more than a few words on the
subject of the prophylaxis of homosexuality and
onanism will be disappointed. I believe it is best
that we turn our attention to these themes only
when we are called upon to do so in our professional
capacity. I advise all parents and educators not to
watch whether a child masturbates or not. The child
quits the habit when it finds other ways for releasing
the tension. And our analyses have abundantly
shown us that it is almost impossible to prevent
masturbation. The evil effects produced upon the
child witnessing marital bickerings, the household
inspiration it receives with regard to judgment-feelings
about women and men, the decisive manner in
which parents affect it when they transfer their conflicts
on the child,—these capital facts the life histories
of homosexuals given above illustrate very
clearly for any one willing to look squarely at the
truth. We do not as yet appreciate how careful we
must be in our relations with the children. Our educators
are still guilty of a serious blunder when they
conceive their duty to be to instill goodness in the
child through the instrumentality of fear. There are
only two educational levers: one’s own example and—love.
The healthiest children come from happy
marriages. It is love that determines whether a marriage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>shall be a happy one and whether the offspring
will be healthy or weak. The unconscious sexual instinct,
manifesting itself in love is the guide for the
regeneration of the human race.<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c012'><sup>[53]</sup></a> Social conditions
favoring early love marriages are the only social reform
to which I look for results....</p>

after puberty show an interest in the other sex before and
during the period of puberty. For instance, I have been told
by a 23-year-old typical homosexual, today a victim of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">horror
feminae</span>, that at 16 and 17 years of age he entertained strong
fancies about girls and ran after them, although without any
particular sexual feeling desire. This transitory and undefined

sort of ‘pseudoheterosexuality.’” (<em>Bloch</em>, <em>loc. cit.</em>, p. 597.)</p>

<p class='c004'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. <em>Ibsen</em>, the great psychologist, has described in masterly
fashion the transposition of sister love into boy love. In
“<cite>Little Eyolf</cite>,” Almers, the writer, suddenly loses the love for
his wife and turns his affection exclusively to his child. That
child is called ‘little Eyolf,’ like his sister, who had once put
on boy’s clothes and called herself ‘little Eyolf.’ The parents
had expected a boy. Almers turns his affection for the sister,
which pervades the whole drama, into the love for the boy. He
has discovered for himself <em>the law of substitution</em> which corresponds
to the changes spoken of in these pages. Little
Eyolf in fact is the dramatisation of the latent homosexual
fixation on the sister. Almers cannot split his personality, he
cannot be both homo- and heterosexual. This inability to
split his self, the root of all homosexuality, forms the background
of the whole drama. Rita cannot divide her personality
any more than Almers can do it; he must give his whole
personality self. Almers cannot divide wife and sister. He
embraces his wife and thinks of the sister (That sister, whom
he calls his little and his big Eyolf. The sister in trousers,
who embodied his ideal, a woman in male clothes, a bisexual
being which need not be split up at all). “<em>Love of brothers
and sisters is the only relationship not subject to the law of
transformation.</em>” <em>Rank</em> (<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das Inzestmotiv in Dichtung und
Sage</span></cite>, 1919, p. 654) and <em>Pfister</em> (<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Anwendung der Psychoanalyse
in der Pädagogik und Seelsorge</span></cite>, p. 72) find the incest
motive easily but overlook the fact that the situation involves
the outbreak of homosexuality and its psychogenesis. It represents
a flight from the sister to man, a wavering homosexuality
sublimated into love for the boy. The drama contains
numerous other familiar points well worth careful analysis.
For Almers, his wife, and his child, are the representatives
of the male, female, and infantile components which we
endeavor to synthetize in our character (<em>trinity</em>). Regression
to the infantile level sets in with flight from the world (flight
to the solitude of the mountain top). The solitary Ibsen, as
road builder, undertakes to construct a new highway which
shall lead up to solitary heights and does not observe that the
road leads really straight back to the realm of his youth. Somewhere
in the vast expanse of his soul the ‘dead child’ is floating
around and staring with wide open eyes into infinity. A
child is killed in this drama. It stands for the miscarried
regression back to infantilism. Childhood is finally subdued
and forgetfulness once more drowns in the soul’s vast expanse
all gnawing and biting reproaches. The memories are all
dead&#160;... and the next drama has for its theme: When the
dead awaken. But in little Eyolf they are already awake....
The dead, whom Ibsen carried in his breast, the corpse to
which Rita refers so often.... The child in him is dead and
now the man in him also threatens to die. It recalls the admission
of impotence, described with such tremendous realism in
the great Rita-Almers scene. The man in him dies and the
woman in him persists with yearnings. A more detailed treatment
of these endopsychic processes will be found in my book
on <cite>Masochism</cite> (Translation by <em>Van Teslaar</em>, in preparation).</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c004'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. The following passage, from an observation by <em>Hirschfeld</em>,
shows how early such fixation on the brother may take
place, only to disappear, apparently, and to be mistaken for
inborn homosexuality: “I hated boys and boyish games; my
sister was my <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">alter ego</span></i>, while my brother, who was 13 years
older and a very beautiful man, had powerfully charmed my
childish, pure and innocent heart. I worshipped him for his
physical beauty even more than on account of his sterling
qualities. At the same time I grew continuously more sensitive
in my overt attitude towards him. I remember clearly
that during the 6th or 7th year my brother’s physical beauty
caused me to shake before him with every fiber of my body
in admiration as before some mystery revealed. At 10 years
of age I wept through a whole night intoxicated with joy
because it fell to my lot to lie down near his intoxicatingly
sweet presence for rest. I had a feeling of shame such as I
did not experience in the presence of my mother or sister.
Clearly and deliberately, although unbeknown, of course, to
him, I deified my brother from the 10th to the 15th year, and
this worshipful attitude reached its highest from my 10th to
the 12th year, when he married. I was disconsolately unhappy
over it because that event removed him from our midst and
I felt it was dreadful that he should lose his virgin beauty,
as I thought.” (<em>Hirschfeld</em>, <em>loc. cit.</em>, p. 46.)</p>

<p class='c004'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. The flaring up of jealousy in old age during exhaustive
conditions, an extraordinarily common occurrence, seems to be
determined partly by endocrinic disorders and partly by the
awakening of infantile predispositions. We also find frequent
mention of the fact that morbid jealousy manifests itself
after a prolonged convalescence in bed. Some physicians are
inclined to trace the condition back to an intoxication. It
seems to me more likely that the unusual opportunity of
mulling things over in the mind is more likely the cause. We
must also take into consideration that facing closely the possibility
of death all ungratified wishes, including the homosexual,
once more flare up, urgently pressing for gratification.
This alone may lead to the flaring up also of paraphilias and
homosexual tendencies during old age, when it must also be
considered that on account of organic changes in the brain
cortex the inhibitions are also weakened. I have repeatedly
noticed that nursing care by a person of the same sex as the
patient also plays a certain rôle. I have even seen directly as
a consequence of prolonged invalidism the development of a
homosexual feeling-attitude towards the nursing person, for
instance, the flaring up of a passion for mother or sister.
Regressions back into childhood frequently occur after infectious
diseases. All the various infantile attitudes manifest
themselves. Psychosexual infantilism, a subject which will be
fully treated in a forthcoming volume of our “<cite>Disorders of
the Emotions and the Instincts</cite>,” is most likely to break out
particularly after a period of illness when one feels one’s
self again a child.</p>

<p class='c004'><a href='#r22'>22</a>. <em>Hirschfeld</em> naturally traces this morbid tendency back to
the social ostracism of the homosexual. In my opinion that
is a forced explanation. The very proneness of the homosexuals
to affective disorders, their heightened sensibility,
their morbid irritability, their endogenous depression prove
that all homosexuals are severe neurotics. <em>Hirschfeld</em> may
be able to trace the homosexual’s acute outbreaks of affective
psychoses back to the actual conflicts. But it is impossible
to link this heightened affectivity to the feminine attitude of
the urnings. For if it were so, how could we explain the
equally distressing analogous disorders among the <em>urlinds</em>?
<em>Hirschfeld</em> refers to the anxiety states of the homosexuals (p.
916) and expressly states:</p>

<p class='c004'>“This very condition is found frequently also among homosexuals
who are psychically normal so far as their home relations
are concerned.”</p>

<p class='c004'>No—they are not normal with regard to home relations,
they are severe neurotics on account of the repression of their
heterosexuality. Superficial appearances are deceptive and
many a person who appears outwardly to be the picture of
health, a well balanced temperament, is inwardly the victim
of a serious neurosis.... <em>Hirschfeld</em> refers further to the
homosexual’s proneness to persecution manias and to delusions
of reference. Concerning homosexual women he states:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Compelled against their inclination to fulfill their marital
duties the homosexual women become very nervous and, in
addition to anxiety attacks, they suffer severe depressions.”...</p>

<p class='c004'>How does <em>Hirschfeld</em> know that the depressions are due to
the enforced fulfillment of marital duties? I know homosexual
women who are divorced and suffer even more; I know homosexual
unmarried women, who are as neurotic as the married
women, and, like the latter, suffer of serious depressions. All
these facts prove that the homosexual pays for his monosexuality
just as dearly as the neurotic monosexual who is
heterosexual.</p>

last of his studies at Kiel he brought to his room a 12-year-old boy from the street under the pretext of carrying some
books for him. When the boy returned he suggested making
some experiments on him, tapped him first on the knee cap,
then had him take off his stockings and kneel on the edge of
the lowermost cabinet drawer; next he forced the boy to stand
up stripped to the waist while he pricked him with a pen in
the armpit and under the fingernails. After that he hung
him by a rope tied around his hands, but the rope broke.
Then he had the boy lie down on the sofa, lowered his trousers
so as to expose the hips and gluteal region and proposed to
pay the boy 5 pfennig for every one of 50 cane strokes.
After the 43rd stroke the boy could not endure the pain any
longer, so he increased the pay to 10 pfennig and gave him 5
additional strokes. It has been ascertained that the man had
been drinking hard the night before carousing until daylight
and according to his own testimony he was very nervous next
day and had palpitation of the heart. He also stated that he
had acted impulsively; he remembered well all the details of
the occurrence but everything took place as in a haze. After
the deed he had a feeling of relief, his usual excitement and
unrest promptly subsided. Examination showed nothing physically
abnormal and absence of any serious intellectual defect
as well.”</p>

The love of green, which is chiefly, normally, a favorite color
with children, and especially with girls, is often observed. A
certain degree of histrionic talent is not uncommon as well
as an inclination towards tenderness, occasionally also a feminine
love of adornments and jewels. It may be said of
many of these physical and psychic characteristics that they
denote a certain degree of infantilism, and this fits in with
the view that homosexuality is traceable to aboriginal bisexuality;
for the deeper we penetrate into the life history of
the individual, the nearer we approach the bisexual stage.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The authors prove that boy love in Hellas was introduced by
the Dorians. Although traces of the custom are found also
among the Ionians, boy love, like knighthood, became fashionable
in Greece through the Dorians. “It was permitted
only to the free citizen, the knight, while slaves were forbidden
to indulge in the practice often under penalty of
death. The practice was regulated by strict rules and became
a state institution. In Sparta, Crete, Thebes the training for
(arety) <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρεθή</span>, among the dominant class was based on
pederasty. The lovers in Sparta were held to a strict accountability
for their ‘companions’ who became attached to them
from their 12th year; so that they and not their youthful companions
were punished for any shameful act on the part of
the latter.” “The battlefield at <em>Chaironeia</em> was covered with
the lovers&#160;... lying in pairs.” In Crete the choice of boy
lovers assumed the form of bridal theft. The lover advised
the boy’s family of his intention of stealing the boy. If the
family did not like the “match” it tried to avoid the capture
of the boy. The higher the lover’s social position the greater
was the honor felt by the boy and his family. The chosen
one was afterwards sent home carrying gifts....</p>

<p class='c004'>In fact, at Thebes, Thera and in Crete <em>such unions even
enjoyed religious sanction</em>. “The engagement of the lovers or
rather their physical union certainty occurred under the protection
of some god or hero at Thera and at Thebes. At
Thebes we find the language unmistakably clear in the high
archaic field inscriptions of the Seventh Century, chiselled
in large letters upon the holy promontory near the City, at a
distance of 50–70 meters from the temple of <em>Apollo Karneios</em>
and on the holy site dedicated to <em>Zeus</em>. They read as follows:
“On this holy place, under protection of <em>Zeus</em>, <em>Kerion</em> has consummated
his union with the son of <em>Bathykles</em> and proclaiming
it proudly to the world dedicates to it this imperishable
memorial. And many Thereans with him, and after him, have
united themselves with their boys on this same holy spot.””</p>

<p class='c004'>At Crete it was considered a shame for a boy to possess no
knightly lover. On the other hand it was a great honor for
a boy to be wanted by many lovers.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the lovers and for the boys these relations had an excellent
effect. Each was inspired to do his best in order to
prove his mettle and be <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθός ανήρ</span> (<em>agathoi anyr</em>). The
heroic tales even took note of this love. The wondrous deeds
of a <em>Herakles</em> were carried out in honor of the male lover
<em>Eurystheus</em>. Repelling a wooing knight was considered
ignominious,—a blot on one’s honor. <em>Plutarch</em> relates the
story how <em>Aristodamus</em> struck down with his sword an obstinate
boy: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Man gerät unwilkürlich in die Sprache unseres
ritterlichen Ehrenkomments</span>,”—states <em>Bethe</em>.</p>

<p class='c004'>With that act the knight transferred his <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρετή</span> (arety),
knighthood, upon the boy. It had a symbolic meaning. Among
the Spartans the pæderast was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰοπνήλας</span> (eiopnylas),
from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰοπνειν</span> (eiopnein), meaning, <em>the one who blows something
in</em> (the inblower). But what was it that the pederast
blew into the boy? Clearly the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πνευμα</span> (pneuma), the soul, a
belief which has come down from the oldest period (Bible)
surviving to this day in Christianity. According to primitive
conceptions the soul of man resided in his various secreta and
excreta. Urine, fæces, blood and semen were magical substances
inasmuch as they contained the life principle. With
his male seed the Dorian endowed his boy with knightly
prowess. (Similarly the savages in New Guinea drink the
urine of the chieftain in order to acquire his skill and
strength. <em>Bethe</em> mentions numerous similar instances.) The
semen was regarded as the seat of the soul.</p>

<p class='c004'><em>Bethe</em> points out also that the liver, the heart and more
particularly the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">phallus</span></i> were similarly identified with the soul.
The reader is referred to the original study for further details.</p>

<p class='c004'>The remarkable notion of blowing one’s soul into another
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a posteriori</span></i>, is traced by the author to primitive beliefs.
Animals showed no objection to these love-offerings; and men
who ascribed magical properties to urine and fæces undoubtedly
lacked any feeling of revulsion against these excreta....
Since the anus was looked upon as the portal for angry
demons, why should not the benevolent magical power of
heroes be introduced the same way?</p>

<p class='c004'>“The notion which led to the development of pæderasty as a
State Institution among the Dorians, could not long endure.
It had to give way finally.... But boy love persisted as a
widespread custom and stood throughout antiquity and
throughout the whole extent of Greek culture as a necessary
feature of decent superior Greek citizenship. The Christian
church fought the heathen custom from the beginning and
was the first to drive pæderasty from Christian society; unable
to root it out by spiritual means, it adopted criminal punishment
in the year 342.”</p>

<p class='c004'>That is, briefly, the philologist’s account, who also states
that during the pre-Doric period (<em>Homer</em>, for instance) the
custom of boy love had as yet no roots as an Institution.</p>

published in <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeitschrift f. ärztl. Psychoanalyse</span></cite>, Vol.
II, 189, 1914. He assumes two forms of homosexuality: 1.
<em>the passive subject-homoerotic</em>, who represents an inborn state
and stands for an intermediary type in <em>Hirschfeld’s</em> sense
and is incurable and 2. the <em>active object-homoerotic</em>, a type
he describes as a special form of compulsion neurosis. The
passive type never consults the physician for his trouble,—he
is a genuine homosexual; the active type is unhappy over his
condition, he shows the typical symptoms. Both share in
common the peculiarity that their own sex is an essential condition
for the attainment of their love-object and remains
so throughout life.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have seen many homosexuals who are interchangeably
active or passive. On the other hand I have seen active homosexuals
who were very much troubled over their condition
and passive homosexuals who have been cured. Incidentally
I may mention that <em>Ferenczi</em> borrows thoughts from my essay
